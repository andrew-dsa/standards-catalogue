This is not finalised. All aspects of this document are subject to change. Please leave comments on any aspect of it.\n\nOfficial\n\nThis document is a living document - it is expected to grow and evolve.\n\nThe base assumption for this RA is that each system and service within government is interoperable. This RA doesn’t go into detail on all levels but is intended as a high level guide to best practice.\n\n[TOC]\nContext\nThe Data Standards Authority has been tasked with creating a general reference architecture for government to enable seamless exchange of data between departments.\n\nThis is to support operational and analytical processes.\n\nThis document does not define what systems to procure, or how to integrate them.\nWhy have a Reference Architecture?\n(Picture)\n\nA reference architecture will bring understanding to the government business and technical estate by mapping and abstracting multiple solution architectures that have each been designed and implemented to fit a particular problem space. \nHow does this help\nMinisters and suppliers can use a government reference architecture to bring understanding to their strategies, visions and objectives when working on systems. A reference architecture can: \n\n\n  reduce IT spend by increasing reusability, functionality and availability\n  reduce technology lock-in by increasing the transparency of the government estate\n  reduce the cost of FoI requests by proactively publishing data, and making it easier to compile responses to requests\n  promote technical innovation across services by referencing new technologies\n  improve communication across government, particularly between senior stakeholders and practitioners, by joining the dots between them\n  improve standardisation efforts by bringing understanding to how different technical and data standards may fit together, and facilitating a ‘bottom up’ standards development process\n  move away from the document centric model of existing Government systems to a data centric model.\n\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive document. This document outlines the basics of technology and culture. It cannot cover every non-technical subject like usability, accessibility, user needs, and security. It is expected that services will follow the Service Standard, and then the Spend Controls process will ensure that they have met its requirements.\nReference Architecture Aims\nTo improve the interoperability of data and systems, which will allow UK government departments to fulfil their function.\n\nGovernment is made up of operating units, for example HMRC, GDS, DWP, DHSC, etc. Each operating unit has multiple operational systems, for example HR systems, correspondence systems, statistical systems. These operational systems can be internally facing, externally facing, or a mix of both.\n\nOften the operational systems will be tightly coupled with the operating units. \n\nThe reference architecture aims to ensure that\n\n\n  Every system can exchange data with each other system\n  Every system produces data in a standard format\n  Every system has an API and that API is documented\n  Every API uses a common authentication protocol\n  Every operating unit can share data with every other operating unit\n  Users outside of Government are able to access data - with appropriate controls\n  External operating units can re-use the software created to run the system\n  Every system and its interconnections have been documented\n\n\nAll systems must expose their data in an interoperable way.\n\nData should be gathered from core data sets.\nCommon Applications\nWe encourage re-use of existing software and components - even if they were developed outside of the organisation.  The decision to buy or build is left to the organisation, but must be in line with Spend Controls policy and must ensure data interoperability.\n\nOrganisations are expected to realise that their needs are not unique. It is very rare that they will be doing something original.  The first task of any technology project is to assess the existing software and services which are available.\n\nWhere possible, implementation of Government-as-a-Platform (GaaP) is expected. For example, no organisation should be rebuilding a payment system, or an email sending platform.\n\nIf a cross-Government solution does not yet exist, organisations must consult with other Government organisations to see if they have solved a similar issue. If so, organisations are expected to work with each other to develop a common solution.\n\nTechnology should be designed and developed as though it were going to eventually be part of Government-as-a-Platform. This means documented APIs, service level agreements, and a plan to scale with demand.\n\nTechnology development must happen “in the open”. All code must be open source, and licenced for other operating units to re-use. Where technology is developed with a 3rd party, care should be taken that the IP (Intellectual Property) rights are understood. Code developed with public money should be made available to the public.\nCommon Data\nWe encourage the re-use of existing data sets. Organisations should be careful not to rebuild data sets which have been created by other organisations.\n\nAll data should use approved open data standards and include metadata to allow for reuse and discovery.\nCommon Model\nA “Service” is the user-facing interface into government. For example “Request a Driving Licence” or “Tell us once about a death”.\n\nA “System” is the component which makes up a Service. For example, the database storing the information, the login system, or an analytics platform.\n\nA well-designed Service is designed to ingest, store, manipulate, and produce data. It is the product of multiple interoperable systems.\n\nThe Reference Architecture is a way to break free of the document centric model of Government systems.  A document centric model is the equivalent of a filing cabinet; documents come in as unstructured data, they are manipulated, and then stored as discrete documents inside a system.\n\nA data centric model takes in structured data from an API, it records events and transactions as data points, and stores structured data. When unstructured data comes in, it is transformed into structured data as soon as possible. When data is requested, it should be provided as structured data through an API.  This may then be transformed into unstructured data (for example a posted letter).\n\nThe ultimate aim is to move to an Architecture which supports Open APIs for every transaction. Individual systems are to be considered only in how they interact with other systems and services.  In this sense, the Reference Architecture is concerned with the interconnections between systems - whether they are internal to the organisation or external.\n\n(DRAFT IMAGE)\n\nZooming in, this is what the Reference Architecture requires:\n\n\n  A service which can scale with demand (Cloud)\n  Access provided via a common authentication standard (OAuth)\n  Producing data in an open format (Open Standards)\n  Accessed via an API (REST or GraphQL)\n  Documented in OpenAPI v3\n  With the ability for external users to access the system\n\nScale\n\n  Government Cloud First policy - GOV.UK \n\nCommon Authentication\n\n  OAuth\n\n\n  See also Our approach to API authentication - Technology in government \n\n\nCommon Formats and Data Standards\n\n  Open standards for government - GOV.UK \n  JSON \n  Any new data formats should be in line with the Open Standards Principles \n\nAPI First\n\n  About APIs - digital.gov.nz \n\nCommon Documentation\n\n  OpenAPI Specification - Version 3.0.3 \n  Describing RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3 - GOV.UK \n\nConformance Levels\nWe understand that not every department will be able to move into full conformance straight away.\n\nWe provide a matrix of conformance by which organisations can assess their maturity.\nConformance Level 1\nThis is the base level of conformance. It shows that a department understands their IT estate and how it connects within and without itself.\nConformance Level 2\nThe starting assumption is that all systems hold data, and that data is accessed via a structured API.  It is important that the API is well designed and takes into account user needs.\n\nThere should be a minimal number of systems which require manual data entry. Manual data entry should be reserved for collection of information that is completely new to government and cannot be collected any other way\n\nThe majority of systems will store or produce data in an open format.\nConformance Level 3\n\n  All systems and their interconnects are documented.\n  Basic API for the majority of systems\n  Open standards for the majority of systems\n  Public documentation\n  OAuth connections\n  OpenAPI Documentation - published to API catalogue\n\n\nAt this stage, the organisation will publish their documentation and actively encourage external users to connect with them. Interfaces will be documented, and OAuth will be the only method of connection.\nConformance Matrix\nThe above, split out into a matrix\n\n\n  \n   \n   \n   Document Existing Systems\n   \n   API\n   \n   OAuth\n   \n   Open Standards\n   \n  \n  \n   Level 1\n   \n   Some documentation of systems\n   \n   Some APIs\n   \n   Internal OAuth\n   \n   Some systems use open standards.\n   \n  \n  \n   Level 2\n   \n   All systems are documented\n   \n   Basic API for the majority of systems\n   \n   Cross Government OAuth\n   \n   All systems use open standards\n   \n  \n  \n   Level 3\n   \n   Documentation is automated and self-updating\n   \n   OpenAPI Documentation.\n\nPublished to API catalogue\n   \n   OAuth open to those outside government\n   \n   Working with Standards Development Organisations to define standards.\n   \n  \n\nAppendixCommon technical architectures\nThese include: \n\n\n  Open Source Policy\n  Documentation\n  Web Services\n  REST APIs\n  SOAP APIs\n  Event driven architectures (paginated) \n  Event driven architectures (non paginated) \n  Streaming\n  Cloud \n  Mobile \n\nArtefacts\nThese are the guiding documents to help the government form integrated digital services and strategies.\nAll of government\nThese include: \n\n\n  The Service Manual \n  The Technology Code of Practice \n  The Open Standards Principles \n  The Design System \n  The Government Transformation Strategy \n\nAcross sector\nThese include: \n\n\n  The HMRC API Strategy \n  The MOD API Strategy\n  the NZ government\n  The BP Trends report\n\nGlossary\n\n  API\n  JSON\n  OAuth\n  GDS\n  Spend Controls\n  Source Code\n  Open Source\n  Freedom of Information Act\n\nThe Culture of the Organisation\nThe overarching philosophy of the Reference Architecture is to drive a culture of openness and inclusivity within the organisation.\n\n\n  A culture which accepts that working in the open is a difficult, but necessary, part of delivering excellent services.\n  A culture which wants services to be interoperable with systems outside of the organisation, and outside of government.\n  A culture which delights in sharing best practices - and learning from other organisations.\n  A culture which thrives on receiving feedback from the public - and making changes based on it.\n  A culture which demands diversity - of people and technology - and works towards a fairer and more inclusive organisation.\n\n\nThe purpose of this Reference Architecture is to set out the minimum technical requirements needed for an organisation to meet this cultural change.\n\nThis culture can be summed up by the phrase “Make things open; it makes things better.”\n\nRead more at:\n\n\n  Government Design Principles - GOV.UK\n  *Data Ethics Framework - GOV.UK *\n\nWhat is a reference architecture?\nIn working to develop a “Reference Architecture” there are many views of what that can actually be. The diagram shows the multiple layers (or dimensions) that constitute a Reference Architecture;\n\n\n  Vision/Strategy - the purpose of our organisation (UK Govt) and the vision and strategy that states its purpose and its intended method of interoperability.\n  Capability Reference - This encapsulates all the capabilities and services that are required to fulfil the vision and strategy. These are broadly split into services (things we do) and admin/corporate areas (things we do to support our services - HR, Finance, Tech, Supplies, Procurement, etc)\n  Data Architecture - What is the data that supports what we do, how is it organised (data model), how do we define it (metadata management), what our core data elements are (Core Data Management), what reference data we use and how common it is (Reference Data Management), what external data do we use and what (aggregated ?) data do we expose to the outside world\n  Application Architecture - what systems do we use to build and perform the services above, what is the level of interoperability that is needed and performed\n  Integration Architecture - how does data move between the systems to support the services above? Have we identified our master data elements and are taking them from the correct place\n  Security Architecture - How do we protect the data we use given all the legal \u0026 regulatory measures we need to comply with\n  Network/Infrastructure - displays the massive wiring and hardware diagram that supports everything above\n\n","url":"/standards-catalogue/Guidance/referencearchitecture/"},"10":{"title":"Publish reference data for use across government","content":"DRAFT Publish reference data for use across government DRAFT\nThis is a DRAFT document for discussion.

It shares the best practice for creating a strategy to manage and support reference data for publishing.\n\nReference data is defined as any data used to organise or categorise other data. This can be data which lies inside or outside an organisation.\n\nIt usually consists of codes, descriptions and definitions of data, for example the ISO-3166 country codes, which are an internationally recognised set of codes that can be used to refer to countries and their subdivisions.\nDefine a reference data publishing strategy\nReference data is a valuable asset which can inform and aid user decisions. Publishing it for the use of others across government is an excellent way to share its advantages while saving time and cost for others.\n\nReference data should be published in a way to make it:\n\n\nalways accessible and up-to-date, maximising its usefulness and avoiding potentially costly decision-making with outdated reference data\nvalidated and accurate at any point in time, with a history of changes maintained, and expired versions still available for consumption\nfindable to its users\nsupported by an organisational infrastructure that can handle the processes and demands of creating and maintaining the reference data itself, and user needs in accessing it\n\nAppoint a reference data owner and steward to manage your publishing strategy\nYour publishing strategy should be effectively managed. A good way to do this is by appointing both a reference data owner and a reference data steward to work together to prepare your reference data properly, and support it and its users after publishing.\n\nThe reference data owner should decide on definitions, policy and decisions about your reference data based on your organisation’s individual responsibility. They should also decide who can access and change the data.\n\nThe reference data steward is responsible for carrying out the rules set by the reference data owner. They are accountable for the quality of the data, compliance with regulatory requirements, and conformity to your organisation’s data principles and policies.\n\nThey should also resolve any practical data-related issues such as incomplete records or queries raised by users.\n\nThe reference data owner and steward do not have to be individuals. The responsibility is best handled by teams, in order to spread the responsibility evenly and improve accountability.\n\nYou could also create a reference data ‘forum’ of individuals drawn from relevant parts in your organisation to liaise and discuss the governance of reference data more generally, as well as in relation to publishing.\nEstablish and use a single, trusted source for your reference data\nYour reference data should be created from a single, authoritative data source. This single source should be placed in a storage system or database, and be known as your system of record (SOR).\n\nIn some situations, you may need to create a reference data by combining several data sources. In these cases, each published reference data set should have its own SOR, created by combining any existing SORs which contributed to it.\n\nEach record in your reference data should be marked with a unique identifier (UID) to associate it with the same SOR for the life of the data set. This makes it easier for your users to index, search and manage the reference data, as well as tracking changes between published versions.\n\nA UID marks a record as entirely different from every other record in a data set. The syntax of a UID should be made up of words, letters, numbers or a combination of these. Examples include serial numbers, stock keeping units (SKU) as found on barcodes on items for sales, or currency codes, as found in international currency conversion services.\n\nYou should also make UIDs persistent, which means guaranteeing they are managed and kept unchanged for the life of the reference data, in order to ensure accuracy and consistency for your users.\n\nWhen using data from other organisations, you should follow their own rules for using their data. For example, use of Ordnance Survey’s UPRN (unique property reference number) dataset needs to follow the\nOrdnance Survey Open Identifiers policy.\n\nYou should also be mindful when creating new SORs and reference data sets to observe government guidance around reusing data whenever possible, and cutting down on waste and duplication.\nPublish your reference data for useability and security\nYour published reference data should be readable by both humans and machines. The Government Digital Service recommends an API-first approach, publishing reference data in JSON format. You may also want to consider publishing in CSVW (CSV on the\nWeb) format, should users need a CSV file. The most important thing is that the format you\nchoose to publish in is most suitable to your users’ needs.\n\nWhen publishing to the web, you should follow GOV.UK guidance\naround best practice in SEO (search engine\noptimisation).\n\nYou should include metadata with your reference data providing an overview of its contents, as well as contact details of its steward, when it was created, when it was last updated, and a brief description of any new changes in the latest version.\n\nYou can find out the best ways to create metadata by reading metadata guidance published by the Data Standards Authority.\n\nSometimes, you’ll find that updating a reference data set instead requires publishing it as an entirely new reference data, as changing reference data that is already being used may cause systems or platforms that are using it to malfunction. For example, the UK Standard Industrial Classification of economic activities must still provide reference data for both 2003 and 2007 to suit different use cases.\n\nWhen publishing a new version of a reference data set alongside an existing one, you should make sure that:\n\n\nthe new version is published as a new, standalone reference data, and not a change or variant of the existing one\nboth the existing and the new version are available to users\ncorrelation between the existing and new versions is made clear to users, preferably in an accompanying correlation document. For example, the UK Standard Industrial Classification of economic activities reference data is published by ONS.\n\nProvide user support for your reference data\nYou should provide a simple way for users to give feedback or report errors when using your reference data, such as with an email link or web form.\n\nKnowing who is consuming your reference data is very important. It allows you to provide better support to users and their community, including during upgrades, maintenance and unexpected downtime. A good way to know who is using your reference data is to encourage users to subscribe to it, for example by giving users the option to provide an email address when downloading it.\n\n:exclamation: You should follow the Open Data Charter, and never require user registration to use your reference data, but let users decide whether they want to register or not.\n\nYour published reference data needs to be secure. This means it should be hosted in a secure environment and access to that environment managed\nsecurely, using HTTPS.\n\nYou can learn more about securing data by reading the GOV.UK Service Manual.\n","url":"/standards-catalogue/Guidance/referencedata/"},"11":{"title":"Guidance","content":"DSA GuidanceDescription:\nThese pieces of guidance are in development by the Data Standards Authority.

Email api-standards-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk if you think your\nAPIs should not be published over public infrastructure.\nFollow the Technology Code of Practice\nMake sure your APIs satisfy the requirements of the Technology Code of Practice\n(TCoP) by making sure they:\n\n\nfollow the Open Standards Principles of open access, consensus-based open process and royalty-free licensing\nscale so they can maintain service level objectives and agreements when demand increases\nare stable so they can maintain service level objectives and agreements when changed or dealing with unexpected events\nadhere to UK government security policies and guidelines and other TCOP security guidance\nare reusable where possible so the government does not duplicate work\n\nUse RESTful\nFollow the industry standard and where appropriate build APIs that are RESTful, which use HTTP verb requests to manipulate data.\n\nWhen handling requests, you should use HTTP verbs for their specified purpose.\n\nOne of the advantages of REST is that it gives you a framework for communicating error states.\n\nIn some cases, it may not be applicable to build a REST API, for example, when you are building an API to stream data.\nUse HTTPS\nYou should use HTTPS when creating APIs.\n\nAdding HTTPS will secure connections to your API, preserve user privacy, ensure data integrity, and authenticate the server providing the API.\n\nThe Service Manual provides more guidance on HTTPS.\n\nSecure APIs using Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2. Do not use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or older versions of TLS.\n\nThere are multiple free and low-cost vendors that offer TLS certificates.\n\nMake sure potential API users can establish trust in your certificates.\nMake sure you have a robust process for timely certificate renewal and revocation.\nConsider linking data (hypermedia)\nYour API may warrant linking your data together. You can make your API more programmatically accessible by returning URIs, and by using existing standards and specifications.\n\nUse Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify certain data:\n\n{\n\n\\“name\\”: \\“Bob Person\\”,\n\n\\“company\\”: \\“https://your.api/company/bobscompany\\”;\n\n}\n\nWhen your API returns data in response to an HTTP call, you should use URIs in the payload to identify certain data. Where appropriate, you should use specifications that use hypermedia, including CURIES, JSON-LD or HAL. This makes it easier to find those resources.\nUse JSON\nYour first choice for all web APIs should be JSON where possible.\n\nOnly use another representation to build something in exceptional cases, like when you:\n\n\nneed to connect to a legacy system, for example, one that only uses XML\nwill receive clear advantages from complying with a broadly adopted  standard (for example, SAML)\n\n\nWe recommend you should:\n\n\ncreate responses as a JSON object and not an array (JSON objects can contain JSON arrays) - arrays can limit the ability to include metadata about results and limit the API’s ability to add additional top-level keys in the future\ndocument your JSON object to ensure it is well described, and so that it is not treated as a sequential array\navoid unpredictable object keys such as those derived from data as this adds friction for clients\nuse consistent grammar case for object keys - choose snake_case or camelCase and be consistent\n\nTo represent time and date\nThe government mandates using the ISO 8601 standard to represent date and time in your payload response. This helps people read the time correctly.\n\nUse a consistent date format. For dates, this looks like 2017-08-09. For dates and times, use the form 2017-08-09T13:58:07Z.\nTo represent a physical location\nThe European Union mandates using the ETRS89 standard for the geographical scope of Europe. You can also use WGS 84 or other CRS coordinate systems for European location data in addition to this.\n\nUse the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) standard for the rest of the world. You can also use other CRS coordinate systems for the rest of the world in addition to this.\n\nYou should use GeoJSON for the exchange of location information.\nUse Unicode for encoding\nThe Unicode Transformation Format(UTF-8) standard ismandatory for use in government when encoding text or other textual representations of data.\nHow to respond to data requests\nConfigure APIs to respond to ‘requests’ for data rather than ‘sending’ or ‘pushing’ data. This makes sure the API user only receives the information they require.\n\nWhen responding, your API must answer the request fully and specifically. For example, an API should respond to the request “is this user married?” with a boolean. The answer should not return any more detail than is required and should rely on the client application to correctly interpret it.\n\nFor example:\n\n{ \\“married\\”:\\“false\\” }\n\nRather than:\n\nperson\\“: {\n\n\\\"name\\”: \\“Alice Betterland\\”,\n\n\\“dob\\”: \\“1999-01-01\\”,\n\n\\“married\\”: false,\n\n\\“validFrom\\”:\\“2011-04-03\\”,\n\n\\“validTo\\”:\\“\\”\n\n}\n\n}\nDesign data fields with user needs in mind\nWhen designing your data fields, you should consider how the fields will meet user needs. Having a technical writer in your team can help you do this. You can also regularly test your documentation.\n\nFor example, if you need to collect personal information as part of your dataset, before deciding on your payload response, you may need to consider whether:\n\n\nthe design can cope with names from cultures which do not have first and last names\nthe abbreviation DOB makes sense or whether it’s better to spell out the field to date of birth\nDOB makes sense when combined with DOD (date of death) or DOJ (date of joining)\n\n\nYou should also make sure you provide all the relevant options. For example, the “marriage” field is likely to have more than 2 states you wish to record: married, unmarried, divorced, widowed, estranged, annulled and so on.\n\nDepending on what you decide, you may choose the following payload as a response:\n\n{\n\nperson\\“: {\n\n\\\"name\\”: \\“Alice Wonderland\\”,\n\n\\“dob\\”: \\“1999-01-01\\”,\n\n\\“married\\”: true,\n\n\\“validFrom\\”:\\“2010-03-12\\”,\n\n\\“validTo\\”:\\“2011-04-03\\”\n\n},\n\nperson\\“: {\n\n\\\"name\\”: \\“Alice Betterland\\”,\n\n\\“dob\\”: \\“1999-01-01\\”,\n\n\\“married\\”: false,\n\n\\“validFrom\\”:\\“2011-04-03\\”,\n\n\\“validTo\\”:\\“\\”\n\n}\n\n}\nLet users download whole datasets in bulk\nWhen providing an Open Data API, you should let users download whole datasets unless they contain restricted information. This gives users:\n\n\nthe ability to analyse the dataset locally\nsupport when performing a task requiring access to the whole dataset (for example, plotting a graph on school catchment areas in England)\n\n\nUsers should be able to index their local copy of data using their choice of database technology and then perform a query to meet their needs. This means that future API downtime won’t affect them because they already have all the data they need.\n\nUsing a record-by-record data API query to perform the same action would be suboptimal, both for the user and for the API. This is because:\n\n\nrate limits would slow down access, or may even stop the whole dataset from downloading entirely\nif the dataset is being updated at the same time with the record-by-record download, users may get inconsistent records\n\n\nIf you allow a user to download an entire dataset, you should consider providing a way for them to keep it up to date. For example you could live stream your data or notify them that new data is available so that API consumers know to download your API data periodically.\nEncourage users to keep local dataset copies up to date\nDo not encourage users to keep large datasets up to date by re-downloading them because this approach is wasteful and impractical.\nInstead, let users download incremental lists of changes to a dataset.\nThis allows them to keep their own local copy up to date and saves them having to re-download the whole dataset repeatedly.\n\nThere isn’t a recommended standard for this pattern, so users can try different approaches such as:\n\n\nencoding data in Atom/RSS feeds\nusing emergent patterns, such as event streams used by products such as Apache Kafka\nmaking use of open data registers\n\nWhen publishing bulk data\nMake data available in CSV formats as well as JSON when you want to publish bulk data. This makes sure users can use a wide range of tools, including off-the-shelf software, to import and analyse this data.\n\nPublish bulk data on data.gov.uk and make sure there is a prominent link to it.\nKeep a log of requests for personal data\nIf your API serves personal or sensitive data, you must log when the data is provided and to whom. This will help you meet your requirements under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), respond to data subject access requests, and detect fraud or misuse.\nWhen to use open access\nUse open access (no control) if you want to give unfettered access to your API and you do not need to identify your users, for example when providing open data. However, do bear in mind the risk of denial-of-service attacks.\n\nOpen access does not mean you are unable to throttle your API.\n\nConsider the option of publishing open data on data.gov.uk instead of via an API. When using open data do not use authentication so you can maximise the use of your API.\nWhen to authenticate your API\nAuthentication is required when you want to identify clients for the purposes of:\n\n\nrate limiting/throttling\nauditing\nbilling\nauthorisation\n\n\nYour purpose will dictate the security requirements for your authentication solution.\n\nFor example, if you need to identify users purely for rate limiting, you may not need to refresh user tokens very often as a token in the wrong hands will be unlikely to threaten your service.\n\nMake sure you consider your API may require more than just authenticating an organisation token, for example, when dealing with sensitive information such as medical data.\nTo provide application-level authorisation\nUse application-level authorisation if you want to control which applications can access your API, but not which specific end users. This is suitable if you want to use rate limiting, auditing, or billing functionality. Application-level authorisation is probably not suitable for APIs holding personal or sensitive data unless you really trust your consumers, for example, another government department.\n\nIf your organisation is managing the API, you will need to manage the authorisation server.\n\nWe recommend using OAuth 2.0, the open authorisation framework (specifically with the Client Credentials grant type). This service gives each registered application an OAuth2 Bearer Token, which can be used to make API requests on the application’s own behalf.\nTo provide user-level authorisation\nUse user-level authorisation if you want to control which end users can access your API. This is suitable for dealing with personal or sensitive data.\n\nFor example, OAuth 2.0 is a popular authorisation method in government, specifically with the Authorisation Code grant type. Use OAuth 2.0 Scopes for more granular access control.\n\nOpenID Connect (OIDC), which builds on top of OAuth2, with its use of JSON Web Token (JWT), might be suitable in some cases, for example a federated system.\nFor privacy and allow lists\nUse an allow list if you want your API to be permanently or temporarily private, for example, to run a private beta.\nYou can add to the allow list per application or per user.\n\nYou should not add the IP addresses of the APIs you consume to your allow list. This is because APIs may be provided using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and scalable load balancers, which rely on flexible, rapid allocation of IP addresses and sharing. Instead of using an allow list, you should use an HTTPS egress proxy.\nFollow good practice for tokens and permissions\nYou should:\n\n\nchoose a suitable refresh frequency and expiry period for your user access tokens - failure to refresh access tokens regularly can lead to vulnerabilities\nallow your users to revoke authority\ninvalidate an access token yourselves and force a reissue if there is a reason to suspect a token has been compromised\nuse time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) for extra security on APIs with application-level authorisation\nuse multi-factor authentication (MFA) and identity verification (IV) for extra security on APIs with user-level authorisation\nensure the tokens you provide have the narrowest permissions possible (narrowing the permissions means there’s a much lower risk to your API if the tokens are lost by users or compromised)\n\nMonitor APIs for unusual activity\nYour API security is only as good as your day-to-day security processes.\n\nMonitor APIs for unusual behaviour just like you’d closely monitor any website. Look for changes in IP addresses or users using APIs at unusual times of the day. Read the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidance to find out how to implement a monitoring strategy and the specifics of how to monitor the security status of networks and systems.\nWhen naming and hosting your API\nFollow our guidance on [choosing an API domain name\n\nAll API naming in URLs (including the name of your API, namespaces and resources) should:\n\n\nuse nouns rather than verbs\nbe short, simple and clearly understandable\nbe human-guessable, avoiding technical or specialist terms where possible\nuse hyphens rather than underscores as word separators for multiword names\n\n\nFor example: [api-name].api.gov.uk.\nAvoid the use of namespaces\nGenerally, each of your APIs should have its own domain, just as each service has its own domain. This will also avoid API sprawl and simplify your versioning.\nWhen you need to provide multiple APIs from the same domain\nIf you provide multiple APIs and you have a business case that means you’ll deploy common services across them, such as common management, authentication and security approaches, you may need to consider:\n\n\nproviding them all from the same domain\ndifferentiating them through the use of namespaces.\n\n\nThe namespace should reflect the function of government being offered by this API. Namespaces may be singular or plural, depending on the situation.\nWhen using sub-resources\nSub-resources must appear under the resource they relate to, but should go no more than three deep, for example:\n\n/resource/id/sub-resource/id/sub-sub-resource.\n\nIf you reach a third level of granularity (sub-sub-resource), you should review your resource construction to see if it is actually a combination of multiple first or second level resources.\nWhen using query arguments\nYou should use path parameters to identify a specific resource or resources. For example, /users/1.\n\nYou should only allow query strings to be used in GET requests for filtering the values returned from an individual resource, for example /users?state=active or /users?page=2.\n\nYou should never use query strings in GET requests for identification purposes, for example, avoid using the query string /users?id=1.\n\nQuery strings should not be used for defining the behaviour of your API, for example /users?action=getUser\u0026id=1.\nWhen iterating your API\nWhen iterating your API to add new or improved functionality, you should minimise disruption for your users so that they do not incur unnecessary costs.\n\nTo minimise disruption for users, you should:\n\n\nmake backwards compatible changes where possible - specify parsers ignore properties they do not expect or understand to ensure changes are backwards compatible (this allows you to add fields to update functionality without requiring changes to the client application)\nmake a new endpoint available for significant changes\nprovide notices for deprecated endpoints\n\n\nNew endpoints do not always need to accompany new functionality if they still maintain backward compatibility.\nWhen making a backwards incompatible change\nWhen you need to make a backwards incompatible change you should consider:\n\n\nincrementing a version number in the URL or the HTTP header (start with /v1/ and increment with whole numbers)\nsupporting both old and new endpoints in parallel for a suitable time period before discontinuing the old one\ntelling users of your API how to validate data, for example, let them know when a field is not going to be present so they can make sure their validation rules will treat that field as optional\n\n\nSometimes you’ll need to make a larger change and simplify a complex object structure by folding data from multiple objects together.

For example, at GDS, we usually contact developers directly but we also announce deprecation in HTTP responses using a ‘Warning’ header.\nProvide users with a test service\nYour API consumers will want to test their application against your API before they go live. If you have a read only API then you do not necessarily need to provide a test service.\n\nProvide them with a test service (sometimes referred to as a sandbox).\n\nIf your API has complex or stateful behaviour, consider providing a test service that mimics the live service as much as possible, but bear in mind the cost of doing this.\n\nIf your API requires authorisation, for example using OAuth 2.0, you’ll need to include this in your test service or provide multiple levels of a test service.\n\nTo help you decide what to provide, do user research - ask your API consumers what a sufficient test service would look like.\nTest your API’s compliance\nYou should provide your development team with the ability to test your API using sample test data, if applicable. Testing your API should not involve using production systems and production data.\nTest your API’s performance and scalability\nFor highly cacheable open data access APIs, a well-configured Content Delivery Network (CDN) may provide sufficient scalability.\n\nFor APIs that do not have those characteristics, you should set quota expectations for your users in terms of capacity and rate available. Start small, according to user needs, and respond to requests to increase capacity by making sure your API can meet the quotas you have\nset.\n\nMake sure users can test your full API up to the quotas you have set.\n\nEnforce the quotas you have set, even when you have excess capacity. This makes sure that your users will get a consistent experience when you do not have excess capacity, and will design and build to handle your API quota.\n\nAs with user-facing services, you should test the capacity of your APIs in a representative environment to help make sure you can meet demand.\n\nWhere the API delivers personal or private information you, as the data controller, must provide sufficient timeouts on any cached information in your delivery network.\nDocument your API\nTo document your API start you should:\n\n\nuse the OpenAPI 3 Specification where appropriate for generating documentation (recommended by the Open Standards Board)\nfollow the GOV.UK guidance on how to document APIs and how to write API reference documentation\nprovide sample code to illustrate how to call the API and to let users know what responses they can expect\n\n\nIn your documentation, you should include:\n\n\ncontextual/overview information - what the API does, who it might be used by and under what circumstances\nbusiness and data rules - under what circumstances is data available or not available\nerror scenarios - preconditions and outcomes - including error codes and messages\ndetails on the test service - how to use it and how to simulate the various success and error scenarios\nfull details of request and response parameters, including meaning, data type and any other constraints - give examples of valid values\nrules on information handling, incident management and risk management\nmethod of authentication (and how it impacts service interoperability, single sign-on, and rate-limiting)\nany authorisation rules, for example, use of OAuth 2.0 and specifically which scopes are required for this API\ndesign changes (recent and planned) and versioning information\navailability, latency, ownership, deprecation policies and status capability\napproach to backwards compatibility\nguidance on configuring the API to make sure it follows any relevant governance frameworks such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and Health and Social Care Network\nsecurity information\ncost of use, if applicable\n\n\nYou should always make sure your documentation is clear, and communicate when changes are made.\n","url":"/standards-catalogue/Standards/lifecycle/apistandardsv3/"},"21":{"title":"ODF 1.2","content":"ODF 1.2\nThe ODF standard works on most operating systems for desktops, laptops, mobile phones and tablets.

DSA API Programme (Charles Baird, Data Standards Authority)\nCharles Baird\n\nOkay, morning everyone. Thank you all for joining. And thank you Sarah\nfor arranging all this. So far I think you can tell the difference in\nprofessionalism between this one and the one I ran in a very amateurish\nway a few months ago. So, thank goodness for Sarah.\n\nI’m going to talk about the DSA API programme that we’re expanding at\nthe moment. Last time I spoke about the API catalogue, I think, probably\nfor maybe half the people here, I have bent your ears over the last few\nmonths about the API catalogue. I won’t only bang on about that today\nbut there will be something about that later. But we have expanded how\nwe think about - I’m going to say “offering” a lot today so I apologise,\nwe’ve expanded the offering around APIs, and we’ve tried to make it a\nlittle bit more comprehensive, so I’m just going to take you through\nthat today.\n\nAnd then, as Sarah mentioned, do put any questions either in the Teams\nchat, or in the Slack channel which has been set up for this. Also,\nthere’s a copy of my slides in the relevant Slack channel if you want to\nhave a look at those. I mean, I don’t know why you would, but knock\nyourselves out(!)\n\nSo, the DSA API offering. What is that? Obviously, the DSA is a\nrelatively new team. And we’ve been working out what we are trying to do\nover the last few months. Some of the API programme is stuff we’ve\ninherited that we’re building on. You know, the API catalogue’s one of\nthose, the API standards, and some excellent work in progress on API\nmanagement and things like that. But we just wanted to pull it all\ntogether into something a little bit more coherent, which maps kind of\nvery roughly to the notion of an API lifecycle.\n\nSo the first thing is the community. That’s you guys, AKA the place\nwhere we nick all our ideas. We’ll come back to this, but obviously\nthese meetings are crucial, that’s why we want to do them more often.\nYour input into what we’re doing is crucial, and really steers\neverything that we do.\n\nJust to run through these, the rest of these. Stakeholder guidance, or\nhigh level guidance around APIs which we’re producing; the next version\nof the API standards - version 3 - which we are hoping to publish in the\nnext two or three months; an API assessment programme which we’re\nstanding up with an initial peer review next month; the api.gov.uk\ndomain, which some of you know about already, which we are formalising\nthis year; the API catalogue, as previously trailed, which I will come\nback to later; and guidance around API management.\n\nSo, to take those in order. Here is a picture of, just for nostalgia, of\nwhen we actually used to be able to meet and talk about this kind of\nstuff. The good news is that although we can’t meet in person, the\nnumbers of people who are interacting with this group is going up, and\nas Sarah mentioned, the sister group, the GDAC community for data\narchitects, and we’ve also got the data sharing practitioners group,\nwho, which is also going to run out of the DSA, and all of which we are\nhoping to cross post to, if you like - just use as a way to expand the\nscope of these things.\n\nAnd the main thing about the community, apart from it’s lovely to do\nthese workshops and meet you all and chat about APIs, is that we get you\nto talk about APIs and how they’re developed.\n\nThat’s the idea behind the new Slack channel, which I will not stop\nbanging the drum for and boring everyone about. As we’ve already\nmentioned, there are channels there for each of the talks today, and a\nlot of the stuff I’m going to talk about today is experimental or, you\nknow, continuous iteration, and this is one of them. We want to see how\nit goes. We feel like there’s a real possibility that we can keep a\nconversation going in between these meetings, and just in general. And\nthat’s going to tie in with a couple of other things I’m going to\nmention. But if you can, if you do get access to, if you can get access\nto Slack in your department, then please do. If you can’t, obviously\nit’s no big deal, we’ve got other ways of keeping in touch, but if you\ncan please do.\n\nWe’re also developing a data, well, what started life as a data\nstandards catalogue. So, this looks a lot like the API catalogue\nbecause, you know, we’re obviously all about reuse. We’re looking to\nboth use this as a place to hold the standards that we endorse as an\nauthority, but also it’s about working in the open. We’re going to do\ndrafting on this. As you can see, it is the front end of a GitHub repo.\nAnd the next version, this is Terence Eden’s draft reference\narchitecture. The idea of having this in here is that you can raise\nissues in GitHub to comment on it, and we can bolt those in.\n\nAnd similarly, the next version of the API standards is going to be,\nwell, is on there right now. And when we put this live over the next\nweek, I’ll send out a link to the group so that you can start to have a\nlook at that. And again it’s just about working in the open. It’s about\nmaking sure that when we are putting this stuff together, everyone has\nan opportunity to comment, and can see that their comments have been,\nyou know, at least considered, even if not included. But the nice thing\nabout GitHub obviously is that it gives us the best way to see the\nhistory of everyone’s contributions.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m about to move on, but I can’t emphasise enough the\nimportance of the community and of you guys’ input into this. It really\ndrives everything we do. We’re a small team and we can’t do everything\nwe’d like to. And so, yeah, stealing your ideas for this stuff is\ncrucial to our strategy.\n\nSo into the kind of products. The first one I mentioned, and mapping to\nthe API lifecycle, is stakeholder guidance. This is envisioned as\nguidance to answer the age old question, which I get asked an awful lot,\n“What is an API and why should I care?” This is, I mean, this might just\nbe personal stuff but I do seem to get asked a lot, “What’s an API?”,\nand it would be great if there was just a document that I could point to\nand go, “Here you go, here’s an explanation.” So we’re going to build\nthat, we’re going to build, slightly less facetiously, a more thorough\ndocument which talks about the benefits of going API-first as an\norganisation. So, what we’d ideally like this to be at the end is a\nresource that you can take to senior stakeholders, and say, these are,\nwell, take them to them, or just use it in your own presentations, and\nsay, “Here are the reasons why we want to do this, and here are the\nbenefits that will come out of this.”\n\nSo yeah, into the next product which is the next version of the\nstandards. Version 2 was published in late 2019, and we’ve been\nconsulting with various people in the intervening time to take\nsuggestions about what should be added. There are various kind of\ntechnical aspects that we want to add. As you can see, to come back to\nthe API, sorry, the data standards catalogue, this is the draft version\nthat is on the front end of the data standards catalogue. Similarly,\nit’s just a front end to a markdown file in the repo, which you can go\nin and examine and make comments on bits of and tell us which bits are\nwrong and which bits are right. We’re looking to - we’re not going to\nchange loads, I mean, it’s a successful document - we are looking to\ntake instructions, if you like, or comments on what the, if the\nstructure of it is correct, if it goes into enough technical detail,\ngoes into too much technical detail.\n\nWe’re looking to add some technologies that are currently not covered,\nspecifically GraphQL which we’re talking to a few of you about at the\nmoment about how we slot that into the standards. And again, what’s\ngonna happen is when this becomes a consultation, we’re going to - I’m\njust seeing a question in the background: the access to these documents\nis going to be on the data standards catalogue, which is on our GitHub\nrepo which I will share the details with, not today because it is still\nbehind locked doors while we smooth some rough edges, but certainly in\nthe next week.\n\nYeah. So when I share that out, one of the first things we will ask is,\nplease go and read the draft of the version 3 standards, and give us\nyour thoughts, and we will fold those into the publishing process. It\nshould be stressed, this isn’t a formal publishing platform, this isn’t\nany kind of replacement for the stuff we put on GOV.UK. This is\nliterally just where we put drafts, for the, again, something I’m gonna\nbe saying a lot today, so that we can work it in.\n\nSo yeah, drafted in the open, and specifically adding new technology,\nspecifically GraphQL. But again, you know, we’re driven by the\ncommunity. If you feel like we’re missing something that’s crucial,\nplease let us know.\n\nSo one of the big new things is the API assessment. We, this is again\nworking on, building on some foundations from last year. We envisage\nthis as happening in two stages. We are looking at, in the first stage,\ndoing some proof of concept peer reviews, so we’ve got a few volunteers\nwith APIs, we want them to be reviewed. We’ve got some volunteer\narchitects from across government. And, side note, we’re always looking\nfor more, so if there’s anyone on this call or in this group who’d like\nto be on our panel of assessors, please drop me a line, either on Slack, \nyet another pitch, or I think most of you have got my email address\nby now, but let me know if not, and I will share it.\n\nYeah, so the first process is going to be peer review sessions with\nvarious APIs so that we can get the format together. And we’re still\ntalking about how this is going to work, but I can sort of envision it\nas having two strands. One which is the kind of less formal peer review,\nwhere it is, a group of architects or technical experts will come in and\nlook at it and make, just make suggestions about the design. I think\npeople are always looking for ways to improve. And this would be a very\nkind of low pressure way to do that.\n\nThe flip side of this is that we would like to get to a stage where we\ncan do automated testing of APIs. So, it’s a, unlike the kind of GDS\nservice assessment process, an API is a technical standard which can\nmeet certain technical, tick certain technical boxes. So, we feel like\nwe could probably build an automated testing suite which can prove that\nthis API is standards compliant, stable and secure, and I’ve put out\nthere because it’s such a natty phrase.\n\nWe’ve sort of envisioned this, again, you know, this is very much in\nalpha at the moment, but we’d sort of envision this tying in with both\nthe domain, which we’ll come to in a minute, and the API catalogue, so\nthat you can see that the APIs that are on those, that have a domain or\nthat are on the API catalogue, have met these standards and so that the\nend user can tell that these APIs are - I shouldn’t read the comments\nbecause “strong and stable” is going to make me laugh, but yes, strong\nand stable APIs, which does lead neatly on to the API domain.\n\nSo we’ve been running api.gov.uk for a while. There are a few\norganisations using it at the moment. We are just about to produce\nupdated guidance to applying for and getting a domain on there. That\nshould be published in the next few weeks. We, GDS, how GDS manages\ndomains in general is in flux at the moment, so we feel like sometime\nduring this year we will need to set up a formal domain registry around\napi.gov.uk. Further information as I get it, but it is, it is likely\nthat the process will evolve. At the moment it’s very informal, you\nbasically email us and say, I’d like one, and we check what the API,\nwhat state the API’s in and how, what you’ve called it, etc. You can\ntell what we do on GOV.UK. And then we just say yeah that’s fine.\n\nBut longer term this is going to be a more formal process, and we would\nlike it to be linked to the technical assessment, and to the catalogue\nso that, as I say, if you have got an API which has got an api.gov.uk\ndomain, that an end user can tell that that has met certain, certain\ntechnical standards, and that it’s reliable. It is another, it is a\nbadge, if you like. Another way of ensuring data integrity and data\nquality from APIs. And I think what usually happens at these meetings\nwhere I’ve mentioned these tests and these, and this assessment process\nis that obviously there are different levels of what an API can cope\nwith, then designed into the beginning. And so one of the big things\nthat we’re looking at, at the moment, is levels here, so that if your\nAPI is something that’s only really designed to be accessed\nintermittently or by a few people that we, that we’ll find ways to to\nforeground that in the catalogue.\n\nSo, moving on to the catalogue. This, I try not to waffle on too much\nabout this, I obviously have done presentations about this before and\ntalked to you all, or many of you individually about this. The API\ncatalogue which we started to do serious engagement for in mid late last\nyear is now got about 200 APIs on there from about 25 departments. And\nit is to be frank, a little bit stalled. It’s, we’ve been concentrating\non the big data producing departments, and I think we’ve probably got as\nmany APIs that way, in terms of working with people there, as we’re\ngoing to get.\n\nOne focus for us now is to reach out to smaller departments and arm’s\nlength bodies and just try and engage with them on this, work out how we\ndo that. But there has been a slight change in direction in terms of how\nwe think about the catalogue, and that’s that we’re going to move to\nwhat we euphemistically describe as a “hub and spoke” model, that there\nis, that there is, the central catalogue will stay there and will still\nbe a front door for government APIs, but we’re gonna concentrate on\nworking with departments to get their, get their API up, their internal\nAPI platforms to talk to the central one automatically. You know, it\nwould be nice if the API catalogue was updated by API, if not, if only\nfor meta reasons. So we’re working with a couple of partner departments\nat the moment with the Home Office, with DWP, who are in various\ndifferent, various different degrees of maturity in terms of API\nmanagement, and we’re working out how best we can hook into those\nsystems.\n\nWe are also talking to various vendors to work out how we can do this\nprogrammatically from other systems. And as I said, we are still doing\nengagement so if you’re on the call and you’ve got an API that’s not on\nthere, do let us know - we’re not changing the model that much. If you\ngo to the catalogue and click the submit button, we will gladly take\nyour APIs. So yeah, the new model for the API catalogue. Somewhat\ndecentralised in that we’re concentrating on the partner departments at\nthe moment.\n\nWhat I didn’t mention was user research, because we have been very\nfocused on data producers and API producers so far. And we’d like to\nmake sure the catalogue works for the end user. So, we’re talking to a\nlot of developers, a lot of product teams about what information they\nwould like to see for exposing the API catalogue, to just, to reduce\noverhead, so that you get, so that it’s, as a product, it becomes\nhopefully more and more relevant to people.\n\nAnd yeah, we’re working with various smaller organisations to try and\nget them both to use the API catalogue, in some, in a couple of cases to\nuse it as their own kind of documentation hub. So, the API catalogue,\nwhich you may or may not know can can publish Swagger docs, can publish\nopen API specs and as I say, for a couple of smaller departments we’re\nlooking at ways to be that front end, that we can take your OAS, and\npublish it as documentation on the, in the API catalogue, so you, if you\ndon’t have API an external developer portal, you can use us for that.\n\nAnd finally, the, our thinking around API Management. So we’ve got, we\nknow that departments have got varying levels of maturity in terms of\ninternal API management, and we’re trying to address, or work with,\ndepartments who are at all different, all levels, in that sense. So,\nwe’re working together in the first instance on an expanded and updated\nset of guidance around API management and that’s work that was started\nlast year that we want to polish up and finalise.\n\nTo that end, we’re working with some vendors to find kind of\ncommonalities and best practice in API Management. We’re working with\nlots of different departments to find out how they do internal API\nManagement, both so they can contribute to the catalogue but also so\nthat we can expose their best practice. What we sort of envisioned this,\nhow we sort of envisioned this as going, is that the initial guidance\nwill turn into a sort of umbrella, so that we have got, it will cover\nlots of different aspects, it will be relatively high level.\n\nAnd then after that we’ll start to do much more technical deep dives\ninto specific problem spaces. So, I don’t know, off the top of my head,\nhow you do OAuth, how you do endpoint security, how you do X, Y and Z.\nWe want to, by the end of this process, we’d like to have a set of\nguides that can help you start one of those off. And to that end, we’re\npartnering with vendors who are in this area and trying to work out\nwhich of them are best placed in specific problem sets.\n\nSarah earlier mentioned the API Management event which is going to be\nhappening in April, there’ll be a couple of vendors who are speaking\nthere, but also we’re going to start bringing them into these things\ngoing forward. So they can present on problems that their products can\nsolve. Most excitingly from our perspective is that we’re going to\nhopefully, well, we’re in early talks with the GOV.UK PaaS team about\ndoing some reference implementations of management software on PaaS so\nthat we can offer kind of easy on-ramp to API Management in the Cloud,\nfor people who don’t know where to start, don’t have the resource to get\ngoing, or are in some way struggling.\n\nAnd that is a neat and completely unplanned segue into the main point of\nthis. The point of the API programme in general is not to come in and\ntell everyone how you should be doing API, you know, how you should be\ndoing APIs, how you should be running your API programme. It’s to try\nand offer help and support at each level. So, we’re supported by you,\nthe community. And then after that we can hopefully offer assistance at\nall levels. We can help you persuade stakeholders how to do it. We can\nmake sure that you’re adhering to standards, and then give you some\nformal assessment on that. We can provide a domain, which shows that,\nshows an end user that you are, you’ve been validated by that assessment\nprocess. We can get you in the catalogue which gets your APIs out to a\nmuch larger audience. And finally we can help with API management and\nspecific problems.\n\nAnd that is a whistlestop tour of the DSA API programme, and I will now\naddress the various questions I saw that have come through in the chats\nand. Yep, feel free to keep putting them in.\nQuestions\nSo, “Why do we need another Slack channel? Why not start groups in the\nexisting cross-government channels?” We have been talking about that a\nlot. And the answer is, as with all of this stuff, it’s an experiment.\nWe think we need a bit of room to spread out. We think we would like to\nhave channels for each panel, sorry, for each session at these workshops\nfor instance, so that the conversations we have here can keep going\nafter the workshop’s over. It may not work out, I think we should be\nvery honest about that from the beginning. You know, it’s an experiment\nthat we came up with two weeks ago, and I’ll give it a go. But, you\nknow, we feel like to have an ongoing conversation and to get into niche\nstuff, it makes more sense to have our own instance, so that we can\nsplit up. So, we will also cross-post to the APIs channels on\ncross-government Slack and the local Gov Digital, which are pretty low\ntraffic at the moment and we’re going to try and see what we can do\nabout that.\n\n“Where can we access these documents?” So as I said, the data standards\ncatalogue, which is going to be the kind of front end for the DSA and\nfor this work, is going to be on the alpha Gov platform. It’s not there\nyet because it’s still a private repo while we test it. But as I say I\nwill send out invitations and links in the next week or so.\n\nRosalie’s put the API guidance question in there, thanks Rosalie. I will\ncopy that over to the Slack channel as well.\n\n“Strong and stable.” Yes.\n\nAdam asked an excellent question which is gonna, which is gonna make me\nrun out of time but “As a steering hand for APIs in government, how do\nyou think about checks and balances to ensure different government\nbodies don’t try and create APIs for the same thing?” I mean, this is\nthe entire rationale around the API catalogue. What we hope is that if\nyou’re thinking of creating an API, you start with the API catalogue and\nsee if there is, if there’s one there that does what you’d like, you\nknow, what you’re trying to do, so that you can reuse that rather than\nrecreate, creating your own. We appreciate that doesn’t always happen,\nbut I mean there is, we have a limited mandate in the sense that we\ncan’t stop people doing it.\n\nWhat we can do is encourage people to, through groups like this and\nthrough engagement departments, we encourage, we can encourage a kind of\npublication process or workflow for this so that an early stage is, have\nyou, as a product team, have you checked the API catalogue? Is there an\nAPI that does what you’re trying to do? And I think, you know, we’ve got\nto, this is partly the thinking behind expanding this community and\nexpanding its reach and the regularity of these meetings is to get this\nstuff out there.\n\n“What does DSA stand for?” That’s been answered [Data Standards\nAuthority], thank you.\n\n“What sort of retention period will the Slack have?” It, at the moment,\nit will be ephemeral. I mean, you can keep, I think Slack lets you keep\n10,000 messages. I think we might take a while to get there. But it’s,\nif it gets, you know, I feel like, as with many things, if it takes off\nI can make a pitch for the budget. And I think, so that, like everything\nelse, it’s experimental and if we make a success of it, it’s likely to\nhave a better retention period.\n\nFrom Rosalie, “You mentioned potentially removing technical detail from\nthe standards. What are some of the details you’re thinking about and\nwhy would you remove it?”. I personally don’t want to remove any\ntechnical details and if anything I’d like to get deeper into it. This\nis, my point there was more along the lines of what, how people respond\nto it as one of the questions we would ask the community to consider.\nSo, is there, is there a case, for instance, for streamlining it so that\nthe technical details of each, you know, if you’re talking about how you\ndo microservices or something like that, in the standards is, is held as\na, is linked to rather than held in the main body because people are\nfinding the technical details too hard. I’m not saying that’s true and I\ndon’t necessarily have the answers to this, but it’s part of the\nquestions we want to ask the community and get them to get them to weigh\nin on.\n\n“Who knows what machinery the government will merge”, fair point.\n\n“Any plans for cross-government API user ID/authentication?” I mean,\nthat’s very much above my paygrade. It’s one of the things that we\nthought about when we were thinking about the levels of the API\ncatalogue, is there a way that we could have a second, secure area of\nthis to, to allow people with more sensitive APIs a bit more peace of\nmind. And then we thought about it so we didn’t want to run, we weren’t\nin a position to run a cross-government ID/authentication platform. And\nso we stepped back to looking at metadata models which allow us to\npublish safely.\n\nNow I read the question again I realise I’m answering the wrong thing\nand this is “Any plans for cross-government API user ID and auth?” Not\nat the moment. But wouldn’t it be great. And I think that’s the kind of\nthing in the manage, that, that you could see the kind of reference\nimplementations moving towards. You know, if someone starts, if someone,\nprobably not us, probably one of the big departments, started to run an\nauthentication platform that could be used across government, I think\nthere’d be a lot of take up for that. And I know that some of the bigger\ndepartments have got quite extensive ambitions for their API platforms,\nso who knows? Not any plans in the DSA but maybe there are some things\nbubbling.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nCharles, there’s another question from Oswald: “What do you mean by API\nManagement?”\n\nCharles Baird\n\nYeah I skipped over that one because it was I realised I only got two\nminutes left! But in this particular instance I think what we’re talking\nabout is API gateways, API catalogues, internal platforms where your\nAPIs are held so that developers can find them. Well, internal or\nexternal platforms. So we’d be talking about something like something\nlike one of the, the API Management tooling platforms like Kong or\nApogee or the Azure API platform manager, sorry, API manager, that is,\nthat will have various elements to it but maybe an API marketplace,\nmaybe an API gateway.\n\nThis is why it’s going to be umbrella guidance because in terms of,\nthere is both that and there’s also the kind of philosophy of how you\nmanage APIs and allow and make sure that people are publishing in the\nright way that people are developing in the right way and that when you\nhave got, if you’re in a large, large organisation with a lot of\ndevelopers, that that they are, they are standardising one platform. So\nthere’s two elements, one of the, one of the philosophy of API\nManagement and one of the technical details. Jacqui answered the\nquestion much better than I could. Which is to say that it’s about full\nlifecycle management of your API. [“API Management is about full\nlifecycle management of your api; including managing it through\ndevelopment, test and versioning in live; ensuring deprecated APIs are\nreplaced/removed”] I couldn’t agree more.\n\nI think if, unless anyone else has got any more questions, that this\nwill unusually, end almost on time.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nYeah, there’s no questions in the Slack channel at the moment.\n\nCharles Baird\n\nThat feels like a personal dig, Sarah, but I’ll let it, I’ll let it go.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nBut, but lots of people have joined it so that’s really positive.\n\nCharles Baird\n\nThere you go. So, baby steps. Thanks everyone. And I think that…\n“[…APIs] can be troublesome” that is a very good point. Let me\nencourage you to come on to the slack and we can talk about it in more\ndetail. Thanks, everyone. I’m really, I’m really looking forward to the\nnext session. And look what’s catching up with you later. Cheers.\n2. PanelIntroduction\nSarah Johns\n\nOver to you. And if all the presenters can put their cameras on. They\nshould miraculously appeal, appear on your screen. Charles do you want\nto turn your video off?\n\nCharles Baird\n\nI will. With pleasure.\n\nTony Heap\n\nI quite like the idea of miraculously appealing, actually.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThere’s Jacqui, we’ve got Gair.\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nMorning everyone.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nWe just, we just need Tony and Katie to appear. Oh, really? I can’t see.\nOh, I guess I don’t see everyone.\n\nTony Heap\n\nIt deliberately blanks out people if they’re too handsome, so as not to\nupset everyone else.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nHow do we do gallery view, that’s a start. How do we make people… Yay,\nfirst, first Teams challenge, how to make everyone appear on the screen\nat the same time. I was kind of hoping one of those seamless you\ndisappear on the screen moments, obviously that’s not gonna happen.\nCarry on and I’ll see if I can do something to help with that.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nOkay. All right. So, hello everyone, and most of you who I don’t know on\nthis call and there are lots of new names, I’m Rosalie Marshall, I am\ncurrently leading on the technology strategy at the home office, which\nfunnily enough does actually have an API strategy component, but I did\nfocus on APIs previously for a number of years at GDS, we didn’t have an\nAPI programme then it was just me focused on this, in addition to other\nstuff. And it culminated in me, writing, helping write the bid for the\nData Standards Authority. And this authority has now, you know, really\nhelped GDS stand up a team around APIs where, you know, Katie and\nCharles have come on board and Charles has just told you all about the\nAPI programme.\n\nSo, that’s me. Onto the panel at hand. And just, just kind of at the\nbeginning just wanted to say, you know, this is a panel for everyone\nhere so please consider what this panel means for you, what do you want\nto get out of it. So, please put your questions in the chat, or over on\nthe Slack channel which I need to open still, but I’ll do that. And over\nto the panellists. So we have a great number of panellists here, who\nI’ve been speaking to for a number of years, and speaking to them about\nthe standards, about guidance, and many of them have presented to you, I\nthink all of them that have presented to you before at different API\ncommunity events.\n\nSo we’ve got, and I’ll pass them, I’ll pass over in just a sec for\neveryone to introduce themselves. We’ve got Tony from HMRC, Katie,\nsorry, Tony was at, he was at HMRC which is why I just made that\nmistake. Katie from HMRC, Jacqui from DWP and Gair from DVLA. And I\nthink it’s brilliant that we’ve got a diverse panel, and we’re even\nmore, more balanced towards women this time, which is quite, quite\namazing because, yeah. It’s actually always, it’s always been quite\ndiverse this community, much more diverse than data has been. But\nanyway, it’s good to see an equal panel, and I will finish up there and\njust pass over to the different panellists for their introductions. So,\nKatie Can I come to you first.\n\nKatie Longstaff\n\nYeah, so, um, previously I’ve been involved in the HMRC’s API standards\nand assurance. So, just looking at how APIs are built and getting\nconsistency around our external facing API status on our developer hub.\nNow moving into delivery management with the API platform, and our\nsecure data exchange service but still be keeping a close eye on what’s\ngoing on in the API community, as I’ll be, you know, involved in\ndelivering functionality on our API platform, as well. So that’s me.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nAll right, thanks Katie Jacqui did you want to go next.\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nMorning everyone so I’m Jacqui Leggetter, and I’m head of integration in\nDWP. We’ve been building and evolving our API platform over the last\nthree years. So we’ve been on this journey quite a while and I would say\nquite mature in this space, we’ve been working with Charles on the cross\ngovernment catalogue, and hopefully I’m going to talk to you today a\nlittle bit about how our strategy is evolving and how APIs have really\nbecome at the forefront of everything that we do in DWP now.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks, Jacqui. Gair, I can see you, do you want to go next?\n\nGair McAdie\n\nYeah. Hi, Gair McAdie, I’m a Technical Architect at DVLA. I might have\nmisread the brief here ‘cause I happen to have a brief summary of where\nwe are, I think we’ve also started on our API journey, about two three\nyears ago, where our data strategy, our data sharing strategy promoted a\nsort of API first approach, and we implemented a vehicle inquiry API\nwhich has become very popular.\n\nSo, yeah, just just, I have a slightly sore throat so I’m going to keep\nit very brief but we’ve got now about around 1000 users on, registered\nusers for those API. And we’ve got about another dozen APIs we don’t put\non our portal because they’re for specific third parties that are not\nfor the public and not secure. So we get a few million requests on our\nvehicle inquiry, it’ll be about a billion today, since we went live, and\nmost of that was under private beta. And we also have about over 4000\nusers registered for our third party across secure and open channels. So\nyeah, it’s kind of taken off.\n\nWe have a quite small development squad for the platform for third party\nsharing, so limited capacity so I’ve just got a couple of brief\nscreenshots to summarise what we’ve done. I also pulled out a couple of\nthe opportunities and challenges which I think a couple people have\nmentioned, in that largely, that, like you say, the someone had\nmentioned I think it was in the chat, that user authentication by third\nparties has been a challenge. And yes, it’d be great to see some\nconsistency and commonality across government. And also, our developer\nportal with a small development squad has been, we haven’t delivered all\nthe features we’d like to do. And again, that’s an ideal opportunity for\ncross government working. So it’s good to see that and the API catalogue\ntaking off.\n\nWe had our own challenges, I won’t bore you with those, but again it’s,\nwe’ve had to come up with a very secure two factor GPG 45 style\nauthentication, which has to be quite bespoke. But yes, I won’t bore you\nwith that. Just a couple screenshots, one showing that our vehicle API\nover the weekend, a couple of days, you know, a few billion requests and\nan awful lot of people going beyond what we’ve allowed them to attempt\nper second.\n\nAnd, sorry, a brief screenshot of that portal, not a great screenshot,\nit kind of highlights we haven’t changed it much for a year or so, but\nit has got a couple of our public APIs on there and it’s, there’s a lot\nmore features we’d like to add. I mean, obviously with so many users\nstart to use this now does help for all these support calls. Trying to\npublish this so initially we’re trying to share our specs via email\nwhich is quite a joke. So, definite improvement, and these are just,\nyeah we’ve had to build our own platform tool on service technology.\nWe’ve got an internal management UI which I’ve tried to do a\nnon-sensitive screenshot showing how many users we’ve got on there, but\nwe have to manage a lot of users through our API channel. And that was\nit really, so yeah, thank you for inviting me.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks, Gair. All right, that’s great. Okay. Oh, I can see Tony now I\ncan see you Katie as well, and so should we, we’ll pass over to Tony for\nyour intro.\n\nTony Heap\n\nHello everyone I’m Tony Heap. I’m the lead product owner for API\nManagement at NHS Digital. NHS digital has been publishing APIs for\nquite a while, 15 years or more. There’s always been an ecosystem with\nCentral National services and external if you like software that’s\ndeployed in GP practices, and pharmacies and hospital trusts etc. So\nAPIs are nothing new to NHS digital, but our user research has shown\nthat people find it really hard to integrate with the National APIs.\n\nSo, our mission is just to make integration easier. So we’re, as you\nmight expect, building an API platform delivering restful APIs, trying\nto make it as self service as possible, improving our documentation. We\nhave not one API catalogue but about, well we did our four, we’ve now\ngot that down to three. And we’re working to get it down to one. But you\nknow there’s a lot of historic information that is spread all over the\nplace so one of our big jobs is to try and pull that all together in one\nplace. We’ve had a recent success in terms of our live APIs on the new\nplatform.\n\nSo, one of the key national systems is called the personal demographic\nservice that’s the big central database that’s got everybody’s NHS\nnumber in it. And, I don’t know if anyone’s heard in the news but\nthere’s a programme of vaccinations going on at the minute for something\ncalled COVID. In order to get a COVID vaccination, you need to have your\nNHS number so every system that’s involved in either booking or\nadministering vaccinations needs to be able to either look up someone’s\ndetails given their NHS number or look up their NHS number given their\ndetails, do a search in a safe and secure way. That went live with the,\nyou know, the kind of national rollout of vaccines that went live last\nweek for the first time and it’s now running at about 200,000\ntransactions per day. So that’s that’s our kind of first foray into live\nuse which we’re very excited about and so far, touchwood, it’s working\nwell. We’ve got 24 by - I’m boasting now, aren’t I - 24 by seven\nsupport, you know, it’s all out of hours and stuff it’s gotta be super\nup. We’re all feeling a little bit like we’re contributing to the\nnational well being.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Tony, that’s been really useful, all your introductions have\ngiven us quite a broad overview of the work that you’re involved in\ncurrently. And I think it, we’ll just turn to to each of you\nindividually, so we can talk about how we’ve been connected in the past\nand how you’ve worked with the API community, before we move to some\nbroader questions, and and those questions will be a mix of of some I’ve\ngot down but also some from the chats, and those will be kind of more\njust, you know, to all of you to pick up.\n\nSo, just starting out, someone’s actually put in the chat “fantastic to\nhear API is at the forefront of DWP strategy.” That kind of gives me an\ninroad into the first question I was going to ask Jacqui. Because,\nJacqui at the DWP you’ve had a lot of publicity over the work that\nyou’re doing, and your API strategy has received a lot of recognition in\nthat. And I was just going to ask why you think this has been, and\nparticularly because I think you’re the only director we’ve got on this\npanel, and, and I’m just interested in what you think you’ve been able\nto bring as a director of integration and and what’s the benefit of\nhaving a senior stakeholder in charge of API strategy.\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nWhile I get off mute. Morning again everyone, so yeah, it’s fair to say\nwe started our journey initially just thinking about APIs and if we\nthink about how we surface those APIs we were very much focused on our\ninternal API economy initially. So when we think about the number of\ncitizens that we support, we were sitting at around about 20 million at\nany given time, and that has increased obviously exponentially last year\nas a result of COVID. We’ve increased by three, four million citizens.\nSo, effectively our API strategy changed slightly for us to focus more\non the citizen journey and bring us more in line with putting the\noutcome based, and debunking demything, what APIs are all about.\n\nSo historically, I mean APIs have been around a long time but\nhistorically, they’ve been things that architects and engineers have\ntalked about. And what we started to do is demystify the use of APIs and\nstart talking about the services that they underpin and start thinking\nabout how APIs support that sharing of data, that sharing of\ninformation, and therefore, leading to better outcomes for the citizen.\nSo, we talk about APIs linked to an outcome. And I think having a senior\nsponsor, not only on my level but all the way up to director general\nlevel, in the DWP, that understand the purpose of APIs, they can\nunderstand what we use them for, and we’ve done a really big evangelism\nexercise across the whole of DWP digital, particularly with our business\nanalysts, with our product owners and with our delivery managers because\nif we identify the right APIs for reuse, we can accelerate delivery we\ncan accelerate our thinking and we can prove, and do early testing,\nearly learning, therefore, leading to quicker delivery.\n\nSo for us it was really a journey to get us to the point of\nunderstanding what was it that blocked engineers and building solutions\nfrom reusing what already existed, why every time we had a new policy\ndemand we would be looking at building a new service or a new solution\ninstead of looking at how can we leverage what we already have and\ntaking that even a step further to leverage some of the common\ncomponents. If we look across DWP and those 23 million citizens that we\nsupport, this may be 25 different benefit lines across DWP. But in the\nmain there are some common processes in those benefit lines. First point\nof contact, we need to validate the citizen as who they say they are.\nThat’s a really common process, not surprisingly, and when we looked\nacross a number of our benefit lines, we all did it in different ways.\nSome people did it by calling the citizen, and some did it by telephony,\nand some asked for passports or documentation, etc.\n\nBut we looked at COVID caused as a response. We had in the first month\nof COVID, despite the furlough scheme that was there and supported a lot\nof people, we had 2 million people in the first month that lost their\njobs that came at DWP, and historically we would have done a face to\nface interview with all of those people. But introducing an API into our\nidentity and trust API, and introducing that into the Universal Credit\njourney, enabled us to automate the authentication of about 2.4 million\ncitizens that otherwise would have needed to be validated through a\nphone call or documentation. So for us it’s about thinking about all\nthose outcomes and how we surface those APIs and making them easy to\ndiscover, easy to test against and easy to use.\n\nSo working with our engineering and architecture community thinking\nabout our platform, and our portal, we put a lot of effort into ensuring\nwe have a portal that’s really rich, we’ve got, I think at the minute\nwe’ve got about 170 APIs in our portal. Given our strategy for common\nreusable components, we’re about to add another 50 odd into that over\nthe coming months. And the portal is a really nice human readable\nformat, a landing page that people can come and search to look for an\naddress, you can type in the word address, and any APIs that link to\naddress will pop up so that you can see it. You’ll not only just see\nthat on a nice landing page, you’re able to see who owns the API, you’re\nable to see the types of processes that it underpins, and most\nimportantly, you’re able to see the API contract, and that’s the key to\nthis. The contract is written in a human readable format so anybody can\nread that contract, and you can see the data, you can see the\ninformation that is sent on the request, and you can see the response\nthat comes back on it, yeah.\n\nSo straight away you can say, I need three of those five data items\ntherefore this API will meet my need, or you may find five of the six\ndata items that you need, therefore you can ask the person who owns it\nif they can add a new feature, or you can find another API that has\nthat. So, these are business analysts and product people and delivery\nmanagers that are having these conversations. An engineer doesn’t come\nnear that until we’ve agreed “What does the thing look like that we want\nto build?” So driving it from that strategy and that outcome perspective\nreally helps us shape the API, shape the service first, before we\nactually start to build it. So when we come to building it we’ve already\nagreed the contract first, the two sides of the interface will have\nspoken to each other about what they’re using it for and they’ll have\ndone all of the GDPR compliance and making sure that that person is\nauthorised to use the data. We’ll have our data standards in place so\nthe APIs will all be built with common data standards and the data\ndictionary and data standards are really key in a good API economy\nbecause having those, if you type first line of address, the first line\nof address is the same for everybody, or a surname is the same surname\nfor everybody, forename, middle name, we’re using the same terminology.\nSame metadata, same data label items, which makes it much simpler.\n\nSo we’ve evolved that into our next way of thinking is looking at how we\nuse APIs internally. We’ve also shared a lot of those APIs externally,\nparticularly in cross government service journeys. So we surface a\nsingle API normally out to other government departments, but we may have\nlayered it under the hood. So we may surface a single API to the NHS. We\nhave, DWP pay a number of qualifying benefits for other government\ndepartments, so NHS free prescriptions, there’s the Help to Save scheme\nin HMRC, free school meals, blue badge, road tax exemption, those kind\nof things. And we can expose a single API for other governments to call.\nThose APIs will be in the register, and that’s what we’ve been working\nwith Charles on, to make sure that those APIs are available in the\nregister and for other governments, other government departments to\nfind.\n\nWe can discover and test and reuse, and we layer our APIs underneath\nthat, so we expose a single API to the other government department, and\nwe’ll call our services to trace the account using a name, address, date\nof birth, a national insurance number - we don’t use an NHS number but\nwe have other matching criteria that we can match a citizen - find the\nrecord, and then give the information. We use the APIs to try not to\nsend loads of data, we try and send a yes or no answer to the question\nthat, does this person qualify for free prescriptions at the point the\npharmacist dispenses the prescription. We landed an API last year that\nenables the pharmacist now, when they record it, to do a check real time\nto see if the citizen’s entitled, and the powerful, powerful impact of\nhaving that real time API for the NHS is obviously loads of error, loads\nof fraud in the free prescriptions space. Saves the NHS when it’s fully\nrolled out over 200 million a year and that’s the power of sharing data\nacross government real time.\n\nSo feeding that into our strategy, we’re trying to look now at holistic\ncitizen journeys. So at the minute we’ve done an awful lot of\ntransformation around if somebody is a pensioner or if somebody is a\ndisabled person, or in a Universal Credit space. We’re trying to now\nthink about a holistic citizen journeys and when we think about our\ncitizen, I may be a person who has become unemployed, I may be a single\nparent, and I may have a disabled child. And currently, that person\nwould interact with DWP through three different product lines, and our\nnew strategy is know for that person to interact with us once, through\nthe yougov webpage, and when they come in through yougov they’ll be\npresented with a series of screens that enable them to self serve, and\nthey’ll be interacting with APIs at the backend that will be taking some\nof their scenario, some of that information, validating they are who\nthey say they are, and almost processing what their needs at that point\nin time. So if we need for example to see a birth certificate of a\nchild, we can ask the citizen there and then “We need to validate the\nbirth of your child, can you upload the birth certificate.” So real time\nAPI is our strategy for that holistic citizen.\n\nAnd I think that’s why we’re getting a lot of interest externally now,\nRosalie, because we’re very public about our intent in seeing our\ncitizen as a holistic person has complex needs. They don’t want to be\ninteracting with three or four different journeys, they want to interact\nwith one journey. It’s like us going to the bank and being told “I only\ndeal with your bank account, you need to talk to someone different about\nyour mortgage or someone different about your credit card”, and it’s\nproviding that holistic view for the citizen and that holistic service\nfor the citizen. And to do that, our APIs will become much more powerful\nnot only internal but externally, calling, creating that economy, that\nAPI economy cross government, so that we can do that real time\ninteraction.\n\nThat’s been driven strategically, that is our application reference\narchitecture, and that is being adopted now and feeding and helping to\nshape our business strategy where we can move our operation staff out of\nprocessing silos into more holistic journey. So if you’re at the, in a\ncontact centre, or you’re in, supporting citizens who come to us for\nhelp, you can support the holistic needs because the APIs under the hood\nare doing that complex work for you, you’re not jumping in and out of\ndifferent systems. So I think that’s what’s really helped having senior\nstakeholder and shaping that strategy mostly. Sorry that was a really\nlong answer I’m just talking you through our strategy.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nAll right, thanks Jacqui. Yeah. Yeah, a full look into your strategy\nthere. So, there are a number of questions coming up in the, in the\nchat, but I will wait and hold on those while we do, while we just turn\nto other members of the panel. You mentioned there about, you know,\nbuilding APIs that are easy to discover, discover - sorry, not talking,\ntrying to talk too fast - and easy to use. And it just kind of brought\nmy attention to some of the work that Tony led, so we’ll turn to you\nnext Tony, with, with great input from Katie as well, but around how to\nmake APIs, ensure APIs meet user needs. So, how to deliver APIs as\nservices, as it were, so if we could just turn to you, Tony to, and\nthat, sorry that guidance was published just before I left the Data\nStandards Authority, so it’s now up online and you can all go and view\nit now, but just was wondering Tony, if you could talk us through why\nyou put so much time into that, and, you know, why you saw it as so\nessential to get published.\n\nTony Heap\n\nThanks Rosalie. So, as mentioned before, I was at NHS digital, spent\nsome time with with Katie and others at HMRC as well, and there, and\nthen NHS digital as well, we did a lot of work to help API producer\nteams build good APIs. So we did work around you know what governance\npoints should there be in the process. How do we make sure they’re kind\nof doing all the right things that we, we think, build good APIs, and\nwe’ve been doing a lot of user research with external developers to find\nout you know what what they needed out of an API, as well. Because we\nhad, GDS, in, savvy people within the teams, we kind of, you know, we\nlooked towards GDS and we saw some really good practices around user\ntesting, user research, the whole thing about discovery, GDSS, alpha and\nbeta phases designed for digital services, which resonates nicely with\nAPIs as well, we had, you know, we already had the concept of APIs being\nin an alpha or in a, in a beta status, I think initially beta, we later\nintroduced alpha as well.\n\nSo, and then conversely, you know, over, over my career I’ve seen some\nanti patterns as well I’ve seen teams build APIs without really thinking\nabout the user need without really thinking about the developer need,\nand building APIs that haven’t been that good and haven’t been that well\nused, you know, perhaps because there wasn’t actually a user need there.\nOr perhaps because there was a user need there but it’s just the API is\neither not documented well or it’s too hard to use etc. So those two\nthings together really and, you know, taking inspiration from GDS,\nsorry, I suppose another thing as well is that people, people would talk\nabout the GDS process and they talk about you know services and they go\nwell yeah but that doesn’t apply to APIs does it APIs are just tech.\nThey’re not services. Now, you know, that then sort of gives API teams\npermission to not bother doing any of the good things that we say we\nshould do for services. And that just didn’t seem right to me and to\nother people as well. So we said well look, we, you know, user research\nis important, user testing is important, discovery’s important.\n\nSo all those things that the GDS say should do for an online digital\nservice, they apply equally well to APIs, perhaps with a little bit of a\ntwist because, you know, instead of citizens being your end users,\nyou’ve got software developers as your primary end users of your API.\nAnd then they’ve got their end users, be they citizens or tax advisers\nor healthcare professionals or whoever. So let’s take this GDS guidance\nand let’s first of all try and validate the idea that it’s a relevant\nthing to do for APIs and, and then let’s try and, you know, explain how\nyou would do it for APIs as well within that GDS framework. So we did,\nwe did some of that at HMRC, you know, we defined phases alpha beta. We\nmay have had a discovery phase, I can’t remember if we had a discovery\nphase at HMRC, but we certainly introduced that at NHSD, and we have a\nchecklist as well for API producer teams to work through.\n\nSo, we have a bunch of governance points, so, you know, kickoff, you\nknow, so the kickoff is like, right here’s the process, make sure you\nfollow the process, because it’s going to help. And then, at end of\ndiscovery let’s have a checkpoint, a bit like a GDS review but an\ninternal thing, end of alpha, end of beta, etc. And really, we could\nalmost be cardboard cutouts at those reviews because the checklist is\nthe thing that kind of forces the people to look at the good things they\nshould be doing, and to do them. And whenever we have one of these\nreviews, we will always iterate, it’s not, this is not intended to be a\npiece of bureaucracy for you. This is intended to be a value add, so as\nwe go through the checklist I always make sure I ask that question, is,\nwas this process helpful, and more often than not, in fact exclusively\nI’m gonna say, they’ve said you know what the checklist was super\nhelpful because, you know, it just helped us structure our development,\nit covers the things we need to do to make sure we’re, you know, we’re\ndelivering a good API, and it’s all been been pretty positive I think.\n\nWe had that session, community session, what, it must be like six months\nago now, where we canvassed opinion from the API community as well. Some\nof you might have been on it to see whether people were bought into this\nidea as well, and we got pretty unanimous support back from that, from\nwhat I remember too. So, so it doesn’t seem to be that contentious a\nthing. It’s certainly working well for us at NHS digital.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Tony yeah that session was, I think, the beginning of last year,\nwasn’t it? As soon as we, as soon as the lockdown started, and we had to\nmove it all online. And, yeah, and here we are again.\n\nSo you actually just kind of mentioned some points that feed in really\nwell to some of the work that I was involved with when working with HMRC\nand Katie, and that was around HMRC assurance process, and there’s been\nso much interest around this from the API community, I’m constantly, you\nknow, forwarding people to you, Katie, to talk about how to do assurance\nand assessment for APIs, and I even wrote a long 14 page case study to\ntry and get all the details of how it worked, which I think is still\nkind of being shared around GDS but hasn’t gone any further. But it\nwould be really interesting to hear from you about, you know, why do you\nthink there’s been so much interest in this process that you’ve got at\nHMRC and just to hear a bit more about it.\nAPI Management Platforms - Build or Buy?\nKatie Longstaff\n\nSo, yeah, I mean that the process you mentioned, we were working on\nsince right at the beginning of our journey when we released our\nstrategy back in 2015, and our first API onto our platform back in 2016.\nAnd I guess the reason why it all came about was because initially when\nwe set up our API platform and gateway we were looking at building APIs\nbasically by the same team that were building the infrastructure. And we\nrealised that that wasn’t actually going to work with the volume of APIs\nthat we were going to be building, and also maintaining the platform,\nthat we needed to have a federated model.\n\nSo we have various delivery centres around the country, and because the\npeople building the APIs weren’t gonna closely in touch with the people\nthat actually own the platform, we thought that, you know, we needed\nsome kind of assurance process, and to ensure that we were having\nconsistent APIs that were being delivered and published out externally,\nbecause if you’ve got different software developers picking them up,\ndifferent accountancy firms and things using them, we want to ensure\nthat if they pick up an API for self assessment then, you know, that’s a\nconsistent design to an API for VAT, or customs, and, you know, we don’t\nreally want people to be using APIs and then having to, you know,\nconstantly read documentation and figure out how HMRC works. We want\nthem, you know, to be able to pick up any API and be able to run with\nit.\n\nSo yeah, it was just all around getting that consistency in place and\nmaking sure that we’re using patterns, you know, set patterns and things\nare working the right way. There are some place, times when that is\nchallenging, and that is when the delivery - sorry, I’ve got my son sat\nat the side of me, I’m getting a bit distracted while he’s trying to do\nhis schoolwork. There are times when it does become challenging,\nbecause, you know, you you’ve got projects or programmes that only want\nan API to be built to meet their needs and requirements, or if you’re\ndoing a government data share where, you know, a particular government\ndepartment needs data a certain way and that doesn’t align with the way\nyou’re wanting to build your API. So, there, you know, there can be\nchallenging times where you need to, you know, discuss patterns and\ndiscuss how things are built, and, you know, that may mean that you do\nsometimes have to build an API that is for a specific purpose and then\nwon’t be reusable. You know, that’s something that you have to weigh up\nwhen building your APIs and getting those APIs out there.\n\nSo if I just, if we just have a look, I did pop, I have got some slides\ndecks, slides from , you know, previous presentations that I’ve done and\nI just wanted to quickly just show that when I’m running through the\nsteps that we have in place because it might just make it easier for\npeople to sort of visualise. So you should be able to see that now. Can\nyou see the screen?\n\nAudience\n\nYeah. Yep. Yeah.\n\nKatie Longstaff\n\nCool. So we’d call this our technical review acceptance process and what\nwe put in place was a set number of things that people need to complete\nin order to get their API out there into live so we have a welcome call,\na product brief, a design clinic, and then we have, you know, various\nassessments on the way through. So when we do this welcome call, we, you\nknow, introduce the API platform. People may not have built an API on\nour platform before, they may have built them for other internal\nplatforms on HMRC or they may have been building web services before. So\nwe have a document that we put together to give them hints and tips and\nbest practices around how to use our various environments, our pre prod\nenvironments that we’ve got built, to prove their APIs before they\nactually deploy them out into public consumption.\n\nWe’ll then hold a product brief meeting with them which is basically\nwhere we want to understand about their API. So what is it they’re\nbuilding, what is it they’re trying to deliver, what are the user needs,\nhow does this API work on our platform, do we need to build new\nfunctionality to support it, are they using something like, say, for\nexample, notifications, sending out notifications to customers, should\nthat become a common component on the API platform, rather than\nsomething that a particular team would build and then wouldn’t be\nreusable. So we hold this meeting, just to, you know, understand what\nthat API is for and how we can help them and how it’s going to sit on\nthe platform.\n\nOnce we’ve had those discussions the teams can go away and start\nbuilding their API. And obviously we promote user research while they’re\nbuilding their API. Once they’ve got that into our dev and QA\nenvironments, and they’ve deployed it to the platform and done some\ntesting themselves, we’ll then hold a design clinic with them.\n\nSo the design clinic is where we get more technical and we’ll look at\nthe architecture and that design and the patterns that they’re using.\nAnd we look at whether they’re meeting our API principles that we have\nat HMRC as well. So, not breaking clients’ software, through functional\nevolution, use of, reusable where suitable, they’re lead by research,\nthey’re consistently designed, and they must perform, so, you know, we\ndon’t want to put an API out there that’s gonna fall over, you know,\nwhenever they get some high volume of usage. So we have this with our\narchitects and tech leads and they will just have a look at the API,\nthey’ll have a look at the documentation, how the JSON responses are\nstructured and whatever responses we’re throwing back and things like\nthat. And just ensure that, you know, they’re not doing anything out of\nthe ordinary. And if they are we will give advice on how they can change\nthat, and things they can do to make it better and align more to our\nstandards on the platform and how we work.\n\nSo then after that point they’ll move into these external test and\nproduction. So we have, as Tony mentioned earlier, we brought in alpha,\nwe’ve got beta in external tests, and then when they move into\nproduction, it’s beta and then stable.\n\nSo the reason why we don’t have alpha in production is because alpha is\njust documentation only, there are no endpoints for them to hit, so, you\nknow, it’s pointless pointing something to production where they can’t\nuse it. So we’ll do the alpha version in our test environment only. It’s\na good opportunity to get feedback on the API, how it’s looking, what\nthe responses are, and it can help in user research for when the API\ngoes into a testable state when they can hit those test endpoints. So by\nhaving these things in place it just means that, you know, as I said, we\nget that consistency and we know that the APIs that we put out there\nwork before they get to that testing, and they are consistent.\n\nSo I think that’s why people tend to want to ask questions and\nunderstand what we do, because when you’re starting off for the first\ntime, you know, getting an API gateway or platform up and running, and,\nyou know, looking at building numerous APIs, you know, how do you manage\nthat and how do you ensure that they’re all built to a certain standard.\nObviously there’s teething issues and it takes a lot of work to get\nsomething in place, but I think for us in HMRC, it’s been good to\nactually, you know, see these APIs be built, be put out there and be\nused by, you know, various consumers, and other government departments,\ninternal HMRC systems where they need to go out over the web and come\nback in again. So yeah, it’s, I think it helps people understand how to\nget APIs built when you’re working on a federated model, like we are.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Katie my connection just cut out for a second so I’m hoping I’m\ngoing to be okay for the rest of the panel. Yeah, that was that was a\ngood overview of your process that you’ve got down, and there’s quite a\nfew comments that are happening in the chat around API management so\nwe’ll explore that topic in a bit and I know it’s an event that Charles\nand Sarah,are planning on running as well.\n\nSo, some very different answers there from Gair, and Jacqui on how they\nhave managed their APIs and the platforms that they have stood up, but\nwe will come to that in a second. I just want to turn to you Gair, and I\nknow you’ve got a sore throat so you don’t want to talk for too long,\nbut if you could just give us, so, something that we worked on together,\nGair, was the domain for APIs, the gov.uk domain. And this was, again,\nit was largely led by you, and you helped us get that going, which other\ndepartments are now using and, hopefully, it should help us collate APIs\nacross government more effectively if we need to in the future. But just\nwondering from your point of view, what do you think, why do you think\nit’s important for departments to use a single API domain? What have the\nbenefits been to you at DVLA?\n\nGair McAdie\n\nYeah, thanks, Rosalie. Yeah, I guess the domain names for APIs, you\nknow, kind of similar to websites in that they need to be simple and\nintuitive, and equally, we need to, we all need to be really publishing\nunderneath GOV.UK wherever possible, just for common branding and trust.\nYou know, and that goes for certificate management as well, the\ncertificate chain. So, you know, I think there were, there were existing\ndomains underneath GOV.UK for services, for public-facing citizen\nservices, and there’s a data.gov.uk but that’s more for public inquiries\nand so hence why we tend to agree with GDS’s going forward with\napi.gov.uk for APIs, there wasn’t a suitable domain. So that’s why we\nended up with that.\n\nBut underneath there, I think, I mean there is existing GDS guidance on\ndomain names. Departments are going to need to request them from you\nanyway. I’ll just share them, they’re quite brief. Just after what\nCharles was saying, these may be changing, but I think they make sense,\nwhat’s there. And there’s a set of guidance there which is largely\nsimilar to websites. You know, you should avoid policy schemes,\norganisation, temporary names, I mean it is a pain for our clients to\nhave to change URLs. It’s not just URLs, it’s certificate management.\nThey need to be static, stable. So we avoided using DVLA in our domain\nnames.\n\nWe use DVLA. gov.uk for more internal things. So we ended up with a\ndriving, a more generic driving licence domain. And then the difference\nunderneath there, the reason why we haven’t gone with the standard API\nname service, api.gov.uk, is that APIs are sort of structured\ndifferently than websites, so websites tend to offer coarse grained\nservices to citizens, whereas our APIs in particular, I guess, are made\nup of a number of slightly finer grained services, some common services,\nmost of which, some of which are common to DVLA, particularly, you know,\nauthentication and credential management, but also we may have address\nlookups, payments other common things that aren’t service specific, the\nstructure’s slightly different, so hence, and so initially we decided to\nput them all underneath a single domain, I mean that approach, you know,\nbecause I think in industry there’s a mix of big companies, you know,\nthe Googles, Microsofts, Facebooks, Twitters and all the rest, have got\na very, you know, very consistently inconsistent approach to domain\nnaming but obviously that single domain is not something that’s a, an\noperational concern for these big organisations.\n\nSo we initially started out as a driving vehicle licencing api.gov.uk\nfor all our APIs, external ones. And that would have been fine. it’s\njust actually technical reasons since then, we found that our corporate\nWAF device doesn’t play nice with APIs, and we’ve had some real\nstruggles with that. So we are now, breaking out from our common APIs\ninto more service specific domain names for blast radius concerns. So I\nthink if it weren’t for that we may have stuck with a single domain. So,\nso, and we’ve had a lot of issues with our clients, you know, whereas\nwebsites, people have a browser and that’s largely easy to maintain,\nkeep up to date. Some of our third parties have very ancient, arcane IT\ndepartments and infrastructure, and boundary firewalls and devices that\ndon’t play nice with, you know, even with one way certificate exchanges\nso, you know, we’re trying, going to try and keep it simple. So this is\nkind of one reason why you might want to stick to a single domain, or\nwhy I think, as is suggested in the current guidelines, that you\nactually use a more wide, public facing, consumer facing service name\nAPI.gov.uk. So either way, it’s not black and white.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks, Thanks Gair, and yeah it’s well worth letting everyone know that\nthis guidance that Gair just shared will, is likely to be updated soon.\nAt least, I was in the process of trying to update it before I left GDS\nand I believe that has now, is now being handled. The main issue with\nthe guidance is currently our instructions around API developer portals,\nand what standards we offer in that area, and I think that’s where the\ncomplexity around API domains can, really comes in is how do you, you\nknow, what, how do you manage your API documentation, and where, how do\nyou, you know, how do you host everything together and how does it all\nlink together. And that’s a, an issue I know a number of departments are\nstruggling with at the moment so I believe GDS are kind of tightening up\ntheir guidance in that area.\n\nSomething that, and, you know, we’ve got loads of good questions I know\nthat we’ve kind of shared as a panel that we want to talk through but\nalso questions are coming in on the chat too, so, hoping to turn to some\nof those. One question is, and I think we’ll go to that first, from\nMashuk, so “How do you build your own portal or use something off the\nshelf?” and we have a number of answers in the chat already, one from\nGair, one from Jacqui, and both of them have gone down different routes.\n\nSo Gair’s gone down build and Jacqui has gone down the buy route, and\nthey’ve kind of briefly explained why they’ve done that. If we could\nactually turn to, I guess, Katie and Tony then, about how they’ve\napproached this. So just interested in your API management, and what\nyou’ve done there. And I know, Katie, HMRC has been involved in the new\nAPI Management guidance that we’re trying to put together around this.\nDid you want to just talk us through how you’re managing things, Katie,\nor have you you homeschooling in this present second? Oh, she’s on mute.\nTony should we come to you?\n\nKatie Longstaff\n\nI was trying to, sorry, I was trying to come off mute and my keyboard\nkept double clicking, and then I’ve got my son tapping me on the\nshoulder, so I’ll give it, I’ll try and answer the best I can! So, yeah\nso within HMRC we went down the build route. And so we have various\ncomponents but initially when we build our API platform was with one\nsupplier, and over time as the API platform developed and the software,\nthe product that we were using and wasn’t kind of keeping up with pace\nof where we were were going, we were, kept having to build security\npatches, and, you know, patch things in in order to make it work, and we\nwere constantly trying to get to, we were constantly trying to get up to\nthe latest version that was available, and Tony’ll be aware of some of\nthis, I think he was there when we were having some issues, but\nbasically our support contract ran out, so we were no longer under\nsupport from this supplier.\n\nSo we made the decision to actually move our gateway and transition on\nto another one. All this was done while we were, you know, up and live\nso we had to transition all the APIs and everything across seamlessly\nwithout anybody actually knowing. There was no downtime on the platform,\nthere was no issues for our end users.\n\nSo yeah basically we chose to build our own, but we also have to be\nmindful that, learn from your mistakes in the past and to choose a\nproduct or, well, not a product, but choose something that you can\nactually develop and, you know, sort of mould to your own requirements.\nAnd make sure you don’t get stuck on something that you can’t actually,\nyou know, use to the full ability that you need to. So yeah, we learned\nthat we needed to move on to something that was more stable for us, had\nmore capacity, and you know just worked the way we needed it to. So,\nalthough building your own has its pros, it also has its cons as well.\nBut yeah, we’re more on the build side than the buy side.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Katie. Tony, what are you doing over at the NHS?\n\nTony Heap\n\nSo we’ve started with buy. So it was really interesting because you\nknow, the experience at HMRC, I could see we’d built a really good\nproduct, it had taken quite a few years to get it to where it was. When\nI joined NHS digital there was quite an impetus to do stuff quickly, and\nthere was also a, you know, we, they were happy to throw a bit of money\nat the problem. In fact, it was almost, sort of a given that we were\ngoing to buy and have something particularly shiny, so we looked right\nin the top quadrant of the Gartner Magic, what’s it called, Magic\nRoundabout, no, Magic Quadrant thing. So we looked at products like\nApigee Mulesoft. There was more, sort of, political keenness to go with\na fully fledged API Management product than a kind of commodity proxy\nproduct such as AWS or Azure.\n\nSo we ended up choosing Google Apigee, and I’m glad we did. I think it’s\neasy to look at it and go “Oh, it’s just a proxy”, you know, how, you\nknow what developers like, “How big a job could that be?”, but it’s all\nthe Admin Tools and consoles that sit around it and the developer hub as\nwell. So, that stuff all came out of the box, admittedly not in the look\nand feel that we would like exactly for the developer hub. So we’re now\nin the process of kind of re-skinning, or rebuilding some of our\ndeveloper-facing front ends to be more on-brand and more customised to\nexactly what we want. But we were at least able to get an MVP live up\nand running with live APIs pretty quickly, you know, we’ve got something\nup within a matter of months, and we’re now iterating on that, and we’re\nkind of 15 months in. So whether we will continue long term with Apigee,\nyou know, we’ll have to see. Obviously, it’s got costs associated with\nit, and we may get to a point where we’ve built that much stuff around\nit that it makes sense to think about switching out for something\ncheaper, but at the minute it’s doing a good job, it’s not ridiculously\nexpensive.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nAll right, thanks Tony. So if there was one thing to bear in mind when,\nlet’s do buying first, when buying an API management platform. Like,\nwhat would it be then, Jacqui and Tony, that have gone down that route?\n\nTony Heap\n\nWho first?\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nEither, either of you. You can go.\n\nTony Heap\n\nI’ll go. No, I’ll go, I’m just trying to think of an answer now. I was\nreally, the evaluation was really tricky because basically, you know,\nall the sales material for all the API platforms will say “Yeah, we’ll\ndo, it does everything, it supports RAML, it supports OAS, it supports\nthis and that” It’s only really when you get into the weeds that you,\nyou know, you discover whether it meets your needs or not. So, I would\nsay, a) don’t spend too long choosing a tool, and b) plan to reevaluate\nthe tool after a period. So, that’s what we’ve always said, it’s, you\nknow, it’s a decision for now but not forever.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Tony, yeah that’s a good succinct summary. Jacqui, what would you\nsay, the one thing, the top thing to bear in mind, or what you, what you\nbore in mind when going down that buy decision?\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nI think the key for me is don’t lock in. Just about similar to what Tony\nsaid, don’t lock into it, and make sure that if you decide, to review.\nBecause the marketplace does change, in fact we have just recently\nchanged after two years, and we’ve moved the product really seamlessly\nbecause our non locking approach, and using a proxy, rather than putting\nall your code into a platform, works much better. So keeping your\noptions open. Don’t lock into anything for the long term. Do a proof of\nconcept if you can, and explore that the product is right for you\nagainst your set of requirements. But for me it’s really that just, the\nnot locking in and keeping it as open source as possible.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThat’s a good point around the open source too, thanks Jacqui, Okay, and\nsomeone has put in chat “Would it be possible to name the product that\ndidn’t work?” So, not sure, I’ll leave that up to panellists to decide\nwhether to answer that in the chat. Gair, and Katie, you both built\nsolutions to API Management - if there was one thing to bear in mind\nwhen doing that, or that you bore in mind when when building yours, what\nwould it be? I can’t make eye contact with anyone to actually shift the\nfocus! So I’ll have to say names, why don’t we start with you, Gair?\n\nGair McAdie\n\nYeah, I just thought I’d try and type it rather than speak it, but yeah,\nI think we did an evaluation as well a few years ago. I think we’re kind\nof at a crossroads again. There’s a lot of features we want to build\ninto our developer portal. We only have a small development squad. But\nyeah, as Katie was saying our requirements are sometimes quite bespoke,\nand they weren’t obvious fits back then. It may be that those tools have\nmatured a little, but from what we’ve seen I think it’s similar to their\nexperience in HMRC.\n\nIt looks like we may be sticking with bespoke. I mean it is also that\npoint I’ve just tried to make that, you know the scale of cloud and\nservers as well, there’s things that means that proprietary tools cannot\ncompete. And also that makes them that much more attainable, I mean\nknocking up some of the, sorry I sounded like a cowboy there didn’t I?\nProducing some of the tooling we’ve had to produce, I mean internally\nobviously things can be done without all the, to look as shiny, but\nthere is quite a lot of tooling around it. So as Tony says, you know, if\nyou want to build something quickly, and you don’t have a large team\nthen maybe you don’t have a lot of choice. But we were able to knock up\nthe, there’s a number of things around the API catalogue, the discovery\ndocumentation as well as, you know, onboarding. Access management was a\nbig thing. And a whole lifecycle tooling around that, internally as well\nas externally, is a surprisingly large undertaking.\n\nBut yeah, I’ve no regrets doing it in a bespoke way and actually the\nskills we’ve built along the way, particularly around service, I mean\nthe kind of thing that they can do for us with next to no efforts, we\nhave APIs that require over 1000 requests a second, and things like\nservice technology would scale with so little effort. You know, we’ve\nactually broken our test tools, rather than the actual underlying\ntechnology stack.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Gair. Yeah, good, good overview. Katie, wondering for you what\nwould, what was the top thing that you bore in mind?\n\nKatie Longstaff\n\nYeah, I think I’m probably gonna come from it from sort of a different\nperspective. So, rather than focusing on, you know, the infrastructure\nbehind the platform and the gateway, I guess for us, what I’d say to\npeople is we had, we built our own external facing developer hub. So\nbecause it’s a public facing website, we went through a GDS assessment.\nSo what I would say is, you know, if you’re building your own things\nand, you know, we built this ourselves, I guess you can kind of look at\nit like our first version of an API catalogue, but because we were\nbuilding that ourselves and, you know, trying to make it fit our user\nneeds, also bear in mind that, because it is external and publicly\nfacing then there are those GDS standards and those assessments that you\nneed to go through.\n\nSo, you know, when you buy a package, you know, I’m not sure how much\nyou can tweak that, or whether you’re, whether people are exposing them\nexternally to the public like we do, but we had to bear in mind that we\nhad these assessments to pass, so ensure you’re using GDS standard, GDS\npatterns and, you know, don’t just build something bespoke for your set\nof users, just make sure you build something good, that meets those\nstandards as well.\nAPI Skills\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Katie. Okay, so we are now an hour into the panel. So I believe\nwe’ve got another half an hour to go. So, yeah, if anyone’s, you know,\nfeeling thirsty, we can stop for a minute, but if everyone’s keen to\nkeep going, we’ll just do that unless I hear from the panellists\notherwise. Gair, I hope your voice is holding up. So we’ve got a\nquestion in the chat around streaming APIs, and let’s come to that in a\nsec.\n\nSo, I think it would be useful at this point to talk about, you know,\nwe’ve been talking about, you know, Gair mentioned skills that were\ninvolved in using, in building the APIs over at DVLA, and obviously I\nguess the different approaches you take to API management will affect\nthe, the API skills you have in your team. Likewise, you know, when we\ncome to talking about streaming in a second, probably a separate, you\nknow, set of skills needed there.\n\nInterested in the subject of API skills and something that I’ve\ndiscussed with members of the panel, particularly Tony, is around, like,\nlack of tech author skills in the API community or in API development.\nJust wondering if we could hear from you all on the panel about skills,\nyou know, what skills are we lacking in government API development at\nthe moment? What kind of challenges is that throwing up for you all?\nShould we come to you, Tony first, since you raised this?\n\nTony Heap\n\nYeah, so let’s talk about tech authors first. That just continues to be\na challenge for us, I think. It was a struggle at HMRC to find good\npeople, it’s a struggle at NHS Digital as well. Good people do exist but\nthey seem to be few and far between. So if you go out for a content\ndesigner, for example, you’ll get someone who’s really good at writing\ncitizen facing content but, you know, not technical enough to write API\nspecs. If you go out for a tech author, we’ve had some real mixed\nexperiences, so some of them might be good at Tech docs but don’t\nunderstand agile and don’t understand, you know, GDS simple writing\nguidelines. And so, you know, we’d have problems, integrating them into\nan agile squad for example, you’ve got the idea of incremental delivery\nand they would rather sit in a corner for weeks and weeks polishing a\nthing, rather than collaborating and working together on it. So it\ncontinues to be a problem, and I don’t necessarily have a good answer\nfor it.\n\nThe other challenge I suppose with tech authors, as Katie mentioned, and\nit’s same NHS digital, we have a federated model for building APIs, so\nwe have API producer teams and then we have a central platform team. So,\nwe tend to advise API producer teams, look, you need someone who can\nwrite your documentation on your team, but that’s not always easy for\nthem to find, and if we just leave it to them, then we end up with\ninconsistent standard of documentation, so we’re kind of toying with the\nidea that actually we have central tech author resources that we loan\nout to the teams and/or are able to quality consistently review API\nspecs. So we’ve recently introduced a governance point in our process\nwhich says have an API documentation review done, and that’s our way of\ntrying to improve consistency. But, you know, finding someone who’s good\nat Tech writing, and also gets the tech just seems to be really hard.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nIt’s interesting that you said that about having a central hub of tech\nwriters, because some of you will know I used to manage the tech writing\ncommunity at GDS, and that was the way we operated at GDS, it was\nhaving, and tech writers actually, when GDS transformed away from having\na community model of management to more of a programme model of\nmanagement, technical writers along with technical architects, were one\nof the only communities that remained a community managed model. And\nthat was because they had to kind of dip in and out of projects and\nreally needed a very strong core central team to, also because they’re a\nrelatively new community within government. Like, I couldn’t find\nanother tech writer when I first started at GDS in 2014. There weren’t\nany around and I was reaching out to Service Group saying, you know, “Is\nanyone a tech writer? What are we doing? Where are the standards?” So,\nyes, that’s interesting about having that centrally managed model.\n\nOther skills and, you know, or, does anyone else on the panel share that\npain of having troubles recruiting technical writers or are there other\nskills that you are finding difficult to recruit? This is open to\nanyone, just jump in.\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nYeah, so we’ve had, we’ve had the same challenge in bringing in\ntechnical writers and writing the API in human readable formats and\nwriting content that people can actually, the whole point of the portal\nis to make things discoverable. If you don’t understand what you’re\nreading on there, it’s of limited use. So we have, we have brought in\nsome external tech writers to come in and write, rewrite the 150 APIs\nthat we had in our portal. Yeah. So we took an approach of, we’ll get\nthese written in a really good way, so there’ve been, the APIs were\nthere, we didn’t change the live service, this was about the write-up\nand the presentation of the APIs for people. So we got the tech writers\nto come in and rewrite them and we’ve created a series of templates\nthat, because we work on the federated model as well.\n\nSo we’ve not changed contracts, we’ve not changed the content of the\nAPI, we’ve just changed how we write it up, how we describe it, and\nwe’ve created standards. And we’re now in the process, we’ve got a small\nteam of, consisting of engineers and content writers that are writing\nwhat we call the engineering playbook. And the engineering playbook will\ndefine, not only the engineering best practices but also how to write\nand how to approach a good API. So, for every engineer that comes into\nthe department they’ll be given access to the playbook and they’ll be\nable to read that, and there’ll be loads of templates that will help\nthem write the APIs. And then we’ve got the central team that own the\nplatform that will have a content writer to review and reflect and help,\nso a bit similar to Tony’s approach not writing everything, but doing\nthe review and making sure that it’s of the right standard before it\ngets uploaded into the portal, so that we’ve got that consistency, and\nwe present all of our APIs in a consistent way in a consistent format.\n\nWe also run the API, it was interested in seeing some of the things in\nKatie’s slide deck. We run API accelerator groups and again we talk to\npeople who are developing new APIs and we talk about standards and we\nuse standard contract templates, that sort of thing. And by using those\nkind of things again we can build in standards, not only to the API\nthat’s being built, but to the documentation that supports it. That’s\nthe approach that we’ve taken, but it’s taken us a long time to realise\nthat we needed all of that, Rosalie.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nI wish the tech writing community was here to, was on this call. I’ve\nnoticed, I think we’ve got a couple of tech writers on the call. But\nthat’s interesting that you’re hiring. And there’s mention in the chat\nabout taking approach to hiring, taking on graduates and training them\nup, which is probably useful in that area of technical writing where,\nyou know, that, it’s quite specific, actually, the work that they need\nto do when it comes to documenting APIs for government. So, so that\nmight be an approach that people want to follow. Gair, Katie any\nthoughts on skills that are, you’re on mute, I think.\n\nGair McAdie\n\nOh, no I’m just moving my mouth without making any sound, I think. I\nthought that was a really good point actually, it’s just that, developer\nportals and hubs are for developers, right? So actually we took the\napproach that it’s been engineers that largely documented APIs and API\nspecs. And that’s been good and bad. I think when you supplement that\nwith API guidance, sometimes that’s been written by engineers and is not\nso well written material, the stuff that I’ve produced, I think. So\nwe’ve talked to service level managers and service designers, alongside,\nand product owners, with engineers, but we’re probably missing that\nthing in the middle which is a technical writer, I’m not sure we have\nany of those, to be honest.\n\nTony Heap\n\nGair, our tech authors commented that he thinks the best way to get a\ngood result is by pairing a developer with a tech author. So, the\ndeveloper that understands the thing and the tech author that can speak\nin plain English.\n\nGair McAdie\n\nYeah.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nAt GDS we did Docs as Code, so that actually helped pair up tech writers\nwith developers, because they were working very closely using the tools\nthat developers used, but pair writing all the material Sorry I think I\ncaught you off there, Gair.\n\nGair McAdie\n\nThat’s alright, I was just going to ask Jacqui, there was a question\nearlier about the DWP portal. Is it available, public? Or is that, I\nthink you were talking about an internal one earlier.\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nYeah, so our portal at this point we’re only making internal. We,\nhowever, share the APIs that are available in the portal with the cross\ngovernment register, so all of the APIs that are in there are in the\ncross government API register.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nI’ve just seen Annie’s given us a wave, she’s a new technical writer at\nGDS. Hi Annie.\n\nTony Heap\n\nI want, there’s one other thing I want to mention as well. So, user\nresearch is also a slight pain area for us, I suppose. Similar with tech\nauthors versus content designers, if we recruit a user researcher,\nsometimes we get ones that are really familiar with citizen facing\nservices and they’ve got all the right sort of soft skills to chat to\ncitizens. But, you know, we find that our audience of developers, is,\nyou know it’s, it’s not a, there’s developers of all sorts, but they\ntend to cluster, in a certain area of their personality space, let’s\njust say, and it’s quite a specialised thing. So, not all user\nresearchers are good at kind of resonating with developers, I’ve been on\ncalls with user researchers and I’m just thinking, don’t ask that,\nthat’s the, you know, don’t ask a developer that, or, I can’t think of\nan example right now, but, again, finding a user researcher who gets\ntech well enough to know how best to interview a developer, but also\nit’s still important right because we’re all developers on the team, or\nmost of us are, so we kind of think we know the user need already, and\nit’s easy to assume we don’t need to do that user research, but I think\nit’s still important to do it because developers come in all shapes and\nsizes.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nYeah. These were the types of conversations we were having when we were\nputting the guidance together around how to ensure APIs meet user needs,\nparticularly, you know, how user research needs to be done a bit\ndifferently for APIs than services, and different things to bear in\nmind. And likewise, you know, having a tech writer rather than a content\ndesigner based in your development team, and what kind of things that\nthey can do for a team as well.\n\nKatie, we haven’t heard from you yet on skills. Is there anything, and\nif there’s not then we can move on to the next question, but just\nwondering from your point of view, is there anything that is difficult?\nI guess you’re kind of more on the assurance side than on the\ndevelopment side itself.\n\nKatie Longstaff\n\nI guess yeah I mean I think we’ve kind of had the same issues as\neveryone else. It mainly has been tech writers that we’ve, when we’ve\nlost a tech writer, you know, it’s taken time to, you know, recruit them\nand get somebody else. But also I think as a general point it’s\nsomething that we are trying to get the balance right with HMRC, I\nguess, is across the board with skills where, you know, a lot of the\nresource is contractor-based and it’s trying to, you know, convert those\nskills into permanent staff. That is a real challenge.\n\nSo, you know, not necessarily just thinking of it from acquiring skills\nas in just bringing someone into the team, but how would you actually\nthen transfer those skills into staff and make them permanent members of\nstaff so that you’ve not got that churn of contractors and trying to,\nhaving to find new people to recruit, I guess that’s a kind of different\ntake on it but it is still a challenge around skills.\nStreaming APIs\nRosalie Marshall\n\nOkay. So that’s been an interesting discussion around skills and like,\nthat, kind of, soft, I guess, soft issue of API development. And we\nshould probably talk about something a bit more technical to give it a\ngood balance, this panel.\n\nSomeone raised the issue of data streaming earlier in the chat. And, you\nknow, how much, how much have you all had to consider data streams.\nSorry, streams for data sharing I think he said. Um, I think it’s an\ninteresting question, it’s actually something that I, again, was working\non over at GDS before I left, and handed this over, but worked with\nCompanies House who have actually in-house standards for streaming data.\nAnd looking at how they approached API development very differently and\nthe types of standards and things that they needed to think about. But\nI, we did actually get this guidance agreed between, well, between me\nand Companies House, but then when I brought it to our team of technical\narchitects within GDS to give us a yes or no on whether we get\npublished, it was actually some quite difficult questions they asked\naround different types of methods of streaming and what, you know, the\ndefinition of streaming and how we approach that.\n\nSo I think it’s interesting, you know, whether we’re talking about, you\nknow, a kind of event-driven architecture in terms of streaming or\nwhether we’re talking about just kind of more common methods of web\nstreaming and, you know, whether it’s web hooks or whatever it is, but\nthere’s lots of different definitions so that question, could, I guess,\nbe interpreted in a number of different ways but maybe just open this up\nto the panel on whether you have considered streaming and what you’ve\ndone in that area. Does anyone want to take that one on?\n\nTony Heap\n\nI could talk about it and I got off mute quicker than Gair, so. HMRC -\nHMRC, see I’ve done it now! - NHS digital, we’ve not really gone\nanywhere near data streaming in terms of sort of continuous flow of data\nbut we’ve certainly done a lot historically and recently in terms of\noutbound data and messaging formats. So, the original architecture for\nthe NHS was one of message flow, so when you move from one GP to\nanother, your data, your clinical data gets transferred, for example,\nvia, by messages from one GP surgery’s IT system to another.\n\nSo it’s been a thing that’s been around for a while and it’s always\nsomething I think that developers have found difficult to integrate\nwith, because, you know, you not only have to call an API, you have to\nstand something up that can receive inbound messages. And over the\nyears, a number of different patterns have popped up for that. So the\noriginal pattern was you had to build a server that would sit and\nreceive messages on an HTTP port.\n\nWe then introduced a kind of a polling mechanism so you basically had\nkind of an inbox of messages and then you would, you would poll at your\nconvenience, so you didn’t have to build a server, you just had to build\na client. We have looked at web hooks as well, as another way of doing\nit. And I don’t necessarily think we’ve settled on any particular\narchitecture as been better than the other, I think sometimes, I\nremember at HMRC with the Customs Service, we kind of offered both\noptions, so bigger high volume developers might want a server stood up\nso they can receive stuff inbound and not have to poll, whereas smaller\nones that were just kind of low traffic, low tech etc just wanted a\npolling API, rather than than a web hook, so it’s probably horses for\ncourses.\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nWe’ve sent quite significant amounts of data to the devolved governments\nso we send an awful lot of data to Scottish Government. We don’t stream\nit though because GDPR compliance all becomes really complex if you’re\nstreaming data outside of your own boundary. We have a single API that\nthey call relating to a specific citizen and then we’ll send a load of\ndata on the back of that one API call.\n\nFor us, streaming will be more linked to events, and our event driven\narchitecture. So looking at life events, a date of death, or a new birth\nin a family, or a change of address, those kind of events. We’ll have\nthose as common events that people subscribe to, and then we will\npublish the event if they’ve subscribed to the topic. So that’s how\nwe’re doing streaming as opposed to streaming APIs.\n\nThe proactive streaming in terms of things like audit trail is something\nthat we’re looking at, we should just have a continuous stream of the\naudit data into the audit platform, so that’s something that we will\nlikely look at but that’s internal within the DWP boundary. So I think\nthat it would be rare for us to think about streaming anything outside.\n\nGair McAdie\n\nI was largely gonna say this, I’m glad it’s not just us, we largely have\nthe same thing where, you know, internally event driven is something\nwe’re moving to and started adopting. You know, and we do use, SQS Queue\nand SNS messaging internally rather than APIs for that. But externally\nwe’ve had calls for Graph API and, and maybe some streaming in one case\nbut but we, again, we steered away from them because they seem to give\nus more problems and solution stuff for the scenarios we had. So like\nyou say, PII data, you know graph, as well, where, you know, security,\nlike has been very explicit about interfaces we hold with our third\nparties, so it’s probably one reason why we stay steered away from them.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nAlright, so I hope that’s given a good overview of, kind of, I think\nthere’s, it’s an interesting area, it’s an area where everyone’s kind of\nturning their heads to at the moment. Hadn’t, didn’t really hear much\nabout it a number of years ago, but it’s something that that keeps\ncoming up, so, and I think that guidance that GDS is working on may be\npublished soon so if anyone wants to input into it. Please just get in\ntouch with Charles, or Sarah, or indeed Annie, who might be actually\nworking on that guidance.\n\nSo I don’t think we’ve, ah, there’s a, oh, Mark is, Mark’s on the call!\nSo, Mark is the person, one of the main people that I worked with on the\nstreaming guidance. He’s at Companies House. So he’s put his hand up and\nsaid he’s happy to discuss this in more detail so please reach out to\nMark if you are developing streaming standards or thinking about\nstreaming APIs. And then, you know, possibly we can actually get a bit\nof community, a mini community around some of that.\nAPI Strategy\nRosalie Marshall\n\nSo, we have less than 10 minutes left on the panel. And can I just ask,\nCharles and Sarah if there are questions in the new API Slack channel if\nyou could put them in the chat here so we’re aware of them. I can’t see\nany more questions coming up unless I’ve missed one.\n\nSo, if we just think about some of the questions we were discussing on a\ncall before today with panel members. One of them was, and I’m selfishly\ninterested in this when looking at the home office technology strategy,\nbut just interested in those of you on the panel, who have either\npublished an API strategy or have one published somewhere internally or\nagreed. What should an API strategy cover and what’s the hallmark of a\ngood strategy? So this is open to any of you to jump in on.\n\nTony Heap\n\nI’ll tell you what we’re up to at NHS digital, so I’m always keen to\nfind the answer to that as you, Rosalie. So, well, we, you know, we\nstarted our API strategy with realising that what we already had needed\nto be made better, so that’s the API platform and then, you know, we\nhave a mission defined as being make integration easier. But recently,\nwe’ve started thinking beyond that so, that, sometimes you might refer\nto that as doing, building the right thing. Okay, so building the\nproduct right, a good quality product for the APIs that you’re building.\n\nThen the next questions are questions like, well, are we actually\nbuilding the right APIs in the first place? And that becomes really\ntricky in our domain, and certainly for other public services as well\nbecause the APIs tend to get commissioned by programmes who have already\ndecided what they want to do, sometimes in isolation, so you end up with\na little bit of silo thinking, and not always necessarily with, kind of,\nthe sort of discovery we like to do if we’re starting from the ground\nup. You know, understand the pain point and then work out actually, you\nknow, what is the right API to build for this? Sometimes it comes in\nsaying we want an API like this and you sort of get a little bit\nconstrained over what discovery and research you can do.\n\nSo that’s, I don’t have a solution to that problem, I’m just stating\nthat it’s a problem, right, so are we building the right APIs is one\nthing. The next thing is around, for us, around API marketing. So on the\none hand, build it and they shall come, but not necessarily. So how do\nyou get the word out there that the APIs are available, how do you reach\nout beyond your existing community of incumbent developers to these\nsorts of entrepreneurs that you said in your original API paper that you\nwere going to attract and disrupt the market and bring new and\ninnovative products to the healthcare space, you know, how do you find\nthose guys. There are places where they hang out, I guess, you know,\nit’s a big job to go and find them, so marketing feels like an important\nthing.\n\nAnd there’s a couple of other things on our radar as well. One is API\nmarketplace, so do we open our API platform up to allow other people\noutside of NHS digital, but within healthcare obviously, to publish APIs\non our platform? So for example, we’re talking to the Department of\nhealth and social care, other NHS trusts that are building services that\nmight be, or APIs that might be, useful beyond their trust. So that’s\nsomething we’re keen to explore.\n\nAnd that then kind of opens up a really interesting can of worms around\nthe governance process, so how do we then govern, and make sure that\neveryone builds APIs, you know, to a consistent level, and security and\ncommercials and all sorts of interesting questions. And then the last\none is around an app marketplace, so do we provide a space for\ndevelopers to share what they’ve built using our APIs, so that they can\nshowcase them and find customers for them. So those are the questions on\nour API strategy at the minute. We don’t necessarily have answers for\nthem all yet.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nSounds like a mature API strategy as they go, or as they tend to go in\ngovernment. It’s something, I guess with the NHS producing a large\nnumber, many different things to think about and actually a lot of the\nchallenges that you’ve mentioned there, and how you overcome them, I\nknow, you know, we were thinking about at GDS in terms of how to\novercome them in a government-wide context. Jacqui, you’ve got a good\nAPI strategy at DWP. What kind of, why do you think that’s been, you\ntalked about this at the very beginning, so I don’t want to ask you to\nrepeat all of that. I guess, what’s the hallmark of a good strategy for\nyou?\n\nJacqui Leggetter\n\nI think for me, there is a couple of components that need to be included\nand one is, what is the outcome that you’re trying to achieve? What is\nthe strategic fit, how does it fit with either, you know, a business\nstrategy, a technical strategy, and therefore it’s hanging on the back\nof a wider enterprise strategy. So an API strategy doesn’t just sit on\nits own. So it’s about the, how it’s enabling, and I think some of the\nthings that was, Tony mentioned there, absolutely agree.\n\nAnd for me, there’s something about defining in your strategy, what is\nyour strategy for making APIs look good? What is your API economy? So,\nis your approach to have a federated model or a single team building\nthem? Is it layering good APIs? Do you keep your APIs granular? What are\nthe things that you’re, are you trying to drive up reuse? Data sharing?\nWhat are the core things that you’re trying to achieve from your\nstrategy? And the evangelism, is there a central team that looks after,\nis it a central platform, is it a federated platform? So there’s things\nlike that that feed into your strategy as well that I think are just\nreally important.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nThanks Jacqui. Gair or Katie, do you have anything on the strategy side?\nGair, you’re, you’re still on mute.\n\nGair McAdie\n\nI’m not, I’m just moving my mouth again. So yeah, I looked for our DVLA\nstrategy, and the closest thing I found was a data sharing strategy\nwhich actually does talk a lot about sharing via APIs, and I think\nthat’s kind of what it comes down to is that it’s hard to put a value on\nan API, whereas with a web offering you can count number of customers,\nhow quickly and easily they can interact with your business, but with\nAPIs you basically just have a single consumer, but they can share your\ndata with hundreds 1000s or even millions of consumers, you know, that,\nwe as government departments may not have large IT teams that are able\nto leverage all the data and get, reach all of our audience through UIs\nwhich are obviously a lot harder to build, not only the data for the UI\nbut the UI itself. With an API, you know, it should be less of an\noverhead and enable third parties to do some of that work for you.\n\nSo we’ve got a real mix, I guess, you know, of APIs for different sort\nof consumer basis from from a single to hundreds of users. So it does\ncome down to that data sharing and as Jacqui says, what’s the intended\naudience. So, yeah, I think it’s something that, GDS has published\nguidance on, was it being API-first? Many, many, more than a decade ago\nwasn’t it?\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nYeah, that’s right, Martha Lane Fox, yeah. We are pretty much out of\ntime but just wanted to give Katie that last opportunity to just comment\non strategy.\n\nKatie Longstaff\n\nYeah. So for us, our strategy was to, you know, make sure that there’s\nmore innovation in the market space, that Tony touched on previously,\nand also try and reduce costs because people, you know, they think that\nAPIs are expensive but if you build a good API and have that out for\npeople to use and you get these innovative third party software\ndevelopers building products to consume your API, you know, try and, you\nknow, move away from having web services for some things.\n\nSo an example of that is our Making Tax Digital. You know, we’ve got the\nVAT API that’s out there for software developers to use and build\nproducts for, and eventually we will be turning off the HMRC software.\nYou know, so you won’t be able to go online and file a HMRC VAT return\nvia HMRC website anymore, it’ll all be done via third party software. So\nbecause we’re turning off that channel, it means that new people will\nactually be encouraged to come along and build products that haven’t\nbuilt things before. And if you build your APIs in such a way that they\nmay be a bit smaller, a bit more granular APIs, rather than a big\nmonolith, people might be able to take elements of that API and reuse it\nfor other things.\n\nSo, for example, as part of self assessment people have been looking at\nAPIs to reuse them to not only file a self assessment tax return but\ncheck whether someone can claim expenses and get a refund on, say, a car\nmileage and things like that. So, yeah, it’s building APIs in a way to,\nyou know, stimulate that demand and reduce costs. That’s what we’ve been\nfocusing on with our strategy.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nIt’s exciting that both you and Jacqui, you know, mentioned API reuse.\nAnd that’s coming up more and more, and, you know, is possibly an\nobjective of the API catalogue, as well. So it’s, I just, I say it’s\nexciting because it feels like we are on a journey here and it’s, you\nknow, it’s been thought more and more about reusing APIs.\n\nI remember at the DWP API community event a few years ago, that Jacqui\nhosted for us all, Richard Banes from your team, Katie, did a talk about\nwhat they are thinking in terms of reusing APIs and we can probably\nshare that presentation if people are interested in it. But that was\nrelatively early days, I think, when when everyone was just beginning to\nstart thinking about reuse a bit more. And now it’s, you know, it’s\njust, you know, part of the strategy that people are thinking about.\nPanel Closing\nRosalie Marshall\n\nWe are, I think, we’re pretty much out of time, I thought we had an hour\nand a half, but just looking at the schedule, we could go on for another\nfive minutes. I know there are questions about bulk data transfers and\nhow to manage those in the chat, so those seem to be, they’re being\nhandled, I think Jacqui’s kind of answered. If other panel members want\nto get back in the chat about bulk data transfers because I don’t know\nfive minutes will be enough, unless anyone wants to jump in from the\npanel on that quickly. So, not seeing anyone jump in, so I think\nconversations over chat should work on that.\n\nThere was a point made from William, who has recently joined government\nafter working in open banking and again makes a comment about streaming.\nAnd so, so that’s an interesting conversation that’s coming up. But\nyeah, I think what we’ll do is, because you know there’s possibly four\nor five minutes left, depending on whether I’ve got the timings right,\nwe’ll call this panel to a close, and I think, you know, if anyone’s got\nany further questions for panel members, I would say feel free to put\nthem in the chat or to, you know, we can perhaps connect you to the\npanel members after so you can follow up with them individually.\n\nBut a very special thank you for, a special thank you, a very big thank\nyou from me to all the panel members for taking those questions. And\nalso, you know, we never really said, I never really said goodbye to you\nall in person before I left GDS but, you know, a big thanks to all that\nyou did for the government API community in helping create standards and\nguidance for the rest of the community to use and to help create more\nconsistency in our development. So just wanted to say thanks for today\nand thanks also for the number of years and work you’ve put in. So, I\nthink with that…\n\nTony Heap\n\nI’m welling up here, Rosalie.\n\nRosalie Marshall\n\nI’ll hand over.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nYou can hand over to me, yeah, Rosalie. I just wanted to say a humongous\nthank you, live from my kitchen while I’m also cooking my kids’ lunch.\nThank you to Rosalie for amazing chairing and such an interesting\nconversation, and thank you so much for our panellists Gair, Jacqui,\nKatie, and Tony, for sharing their immense experience and learning for\nus all. I’m new to APIs and new to this community, I’ve just learned so\nmuch in this last 90 minutes. So, really, really, loads of, thank you\nfor taking part there.\n3. Digital Object Identifiers - Terence Eden, Data Standards Authority\nSarah Johns\n\nSo next up we have Terence Eden, from the Data Standards Authority,\ntalking about his work on digital object identifiers.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nI hope you can all hear me okay. And you should now be able to see some\nvery exciting slides,\n\nSarah Johns\n\nWe can see that. Very Cabinet Office slides. Yeah,\n\nTerence Eden\n\nLook at that, isn’t it amazing when technology works? Hi everyone, my\nname is Terence Eden, I work in the Data Standards Authority, and I want\nto talk to you today about this: DOIs. Digital Object Identifiers. Some\nof you are going to be familiar with these, some aren’t, so I’m going to\nstart by saying this: DOI, WTF? Which I’m reliably informed stands for\n“Wednesday, Thursday, Friday”.\n\nDigital Object Identifiers are a way to identify digital objects, such\nas government documents. DOIs are really well used in the academic\nsector, so lots of datasets and lots of academic publications have a\nDOI, which means that academics are able to cite documents really\neasily.\n\nWe’ve been given a challenge on how we can make government datasets more\naccessible to researchers. So, we’ve been looking at DOIs. In true GDS\nfashion, we start with user needs. I’m going to tell you a bit about\nwhat these are and how they sort of tie in with the API work we’re\ndoing. So, this is the primary user need that we’re serving which is:\n“As an academic, I want a simple way to cite government data.” At the\nmoment, when an academic cites government data or a government document,\nthey tend to use a URL, so www.gov.uk/ this/that/the-other. That’s okay.\nbut it comes with a few drawbacks.\n\nThe first one is is that sometimes URLs change. They shouldn’t, but\nsometimes they do. And the second issue is, there is no way to get\nmetadata out of a URL. I mean, you might be able to get the domain name,\nif we’ve marked up the document properly you might be able to get the\ndate, but anything more complicated than that, you’re simply not going\nto be able to get.\n\nSo we have a second user need which is: “As a publisher I want to track\nthe usage of government datasets.” So, we know that government data is\nimportant and government publishes, you know, terabytes of data, every\nmonth. But who’s using it? At some point, a chief executive or a\nDirector General or a minister is going to turn around and say, “We’re\npublishing all of this data, who’s using it? Is this good value for\nmoney?” and we’re going to need to be able to show that it is, or show\nthat it isn’t.\n\nOne of the great things about using DOIs is they are really easy to\nsearch for and there are a lot of, there are a lot of metadata search\nAPIs which allow you to say, as an academic, show me all the times that\nmy paper has been cited in other papers. Which means that as a publisher\nof data, the government can say, show me all the times that government\ndocuments have been cited. Fantastic.\n\nSo that’s a sort of overview of why we’re trying to do it. I’m going to\ntalk a little about the practicalities. So, this is what a DOI looks\nlike. It is a singularly unlovely string of numbers, and it is not\ndesigned to be human readable, there is not designed to have any\nmetadata in this. The ‘10.’ indicates that this is a DOI. The numbers\nafter the dot is the organisation who publishes, and then the string\nafter that is the unique reference.\n\nSo, the idea is that you create a dataset, you then create a DOI to go\nwith it, you put the DOI in the dataset and when an academic comes\nalong, they say, oh, this is, what a brilliant piece of data about some\namazing government thing! I want to include this in my thesis, in my\ndocument, my published paper. How do I do that? Well, I take this DOI\nand then I send it to an API, so, and there are lots of different\ncommercial and non commercial APIs out there, a whole bunch of\ndecentralised APIs. You submit a DOI and you get back - I’ve included a\nscrap here - metadata about this document. So, who published it, when\nwas it published, what sort of document is it, when was it last updated,\nwhat language is it in? All of these sorts of things which are, you\nknow, vital for academics understanding who they’re citing, why they’re\nciting, you know, putting references in, and also really useful for\ntext, for data mining as well, if we want to understand what documents\nare cited the most, which publishers are cited the most, this is, you\nknow, sort of, absolutely vital.\n\nSo this does come with some API challenges for government as well. But\nthis is why we want to do this. One, we know that URLs die, or they\nchange. There is no consistent way to get metadata out of government\ndocuments. Tracking URLs to see who’s been citing our data is hard. But\nmost importantly, this is the way. This is the scheme that 100% of\nacademics have converged on. They want to use API, uh, they want to use\nDOIs. And if we want to serve our user needs, we need to start using\nthem.\n\nBut it comes with some hard questions. So, there will have to be some\nchanges to the way we publish data on GOV. UK to include DOIs. Is this\ngoing to add friction? So, are we going to need to create our own DOI\nAPI, which is a bit of a tongue twister, in order to automate the\ncreation of this metadata? Is that going to add time and friction when\npeople want to publish data?\n\nReally important, for example, when we’re publishing COVID-19 stats. You\nknow, people want them at a minute past midnight every single day. Does,\nyou know, integrating this delay the publication of vital stats? Is it\ngoing to confuse normal people? I mean, if you’ve never encountered a\nDOI before and you see that string of numbers, what does that tell you?\nDo we need more explainers? Do we need, you know, a way to signal to\npeople that, look, this probably isn’t for you, this is for a specific\ncommunity.\n\nAnd are there privacy concerns? So as I said, there are a bunch of APIs\nwhere you can retrieve DOI metadata, but, what are they doing with your\ndata? So when you go to, I’ll pick one at random, you know, data site\nand you say, please give me all the metadata for this DOI. Is their API\nrecording that you’re looking at that? Probably not, but we have to be\naware of that. Does that mean that we need to create an API specifically\nso that if people want to look up government DOIs without giving their\ndata to anyone else, they can do it, for us, maybe. Do we need to create\na DOI, uh an API, so that people can create their own DOIs? Almost\ncertainly. We’re talking to the British Library about using theirs.\n\nThis has just been a whistlestop tour of these things and we do have\nfurther readings, so we’ve published a blog post, explaining this in a\nbit more detail. We’re also running a consultation on GitHub at the\nmoment where we’ve had loads of responses from academics and publishers\nand people of government, and normal users, all, you know, talking about\nwhether this is a good thing, how an API for this would work.\n\nAnd so I’m really interested in hearing your feedback. I’m happy to take\nit today, happy to take it over the next few weeks. What do you think\nabout the idea of creating metadata for government records, via an API\nand retrieving it via an API, all backed by DOIs? Thank you very much.\nQuestions\nTerence Eden\n\nI’m gonna stop sharing and come back here and take a look and see what\nquestions we have. So I’m just going to scroll back. If anyone’s, can’t\ntype in and wants to just shout out please unmute yourself and and come\non now.\n\nCharles Baird\n\nCan I jump in, Terence? I was gonna ask you something. I appreciate\nthat, you know, I’m on the inside so I should know all this stuff\nalready, but I’m just interested, can you talk a little bit about how\nthe infrastructure works in, you know, obviously this stuff is, you’re\nproducing them but presumably this is backed by a database of these\nthings, you know.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nThat’s exactly right. Yeah. So, the technical term for it is “minting” a\nDOI. So, because you own the prefix 10.1234, you can mint a DOI which is\nthe, sort of, the entire string, just on your database. So what you do,\neffectively, is, well with the British Library one there’s a form, you\ntype in all the metadata, so the name of the author, the date and\neverything, you hit go, it generates a unique ID for you, which it\nstores in the database, and then it distributes around.\n\nSo you might think of it a bit like DNS, a Domain Name System for the\ninternet. So, you can query any name server, and find out where a domain\nname points to, you can query any DOI database record, and it will bring\nback the metadata for you. But yes, it is minted just for you, and\nupdated just by you as well.\n\nCharles Baird\n\nSo in principle, the, in this kind of instance the government would run\nthe equivalent of a name server for DOIs, which would be the ones that\nwe’d minted.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nYes, effectively, but then of course once they get published, they get\ndistributed so they don’t necessarily hit back. But, and again, the idea\nthat we have is that, we are really bad at updating metadata in\ngovernment, so what we’re hoping for is that, to make, if we can make it\neasier, whether via an API or a form or something else, that will\nencourage people to update their metadata and then that gets distributed\naround the entire system as well.\n\nCharles Baird\n\nFair enough. Okay, I’ll stop taking up time and let, you’ve got hundreds\nof questions so I’ll let you go.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nRight, so Jon says “DOIs have a much wider audience than academics.”\nYes, that’s absolutely right. And one of the things that we’re looking\nat is, we’re starting with a small trial with datasets, I think we’ll\nprobably go with Office for National Statistics first, but it is\npossible that, you know, you could put a DOI on every paper and\nannouncement, you know, made on GOV.uk.\n\nTerence Eden\n\n“How granular are DOIs? Is it just for datasets as a whole or specific\nrows or a field?” Paul, that’s an excellent question. At the moment, it\nis for the dataset as a whole. So, the idea is, you know, here is your,\nyou know, 10MB CSV, that has a single DOI.\n\nNow, as we move into an API future, web apps aren’t going to be\npublishing datasets like that anymore. We’ll be asking people to\nretrieve something from a, from an API. So you could, and this is a\nfuture proposal, you could associate a DOI with an API query, just to\nsay, look, this is the API query that I had, and here is the DOI which,\nyou know, gets that. Or you could say, here is a DOI for that specific\ndatabase at that specific time. Still working on that.\n\nTimothy likes DOIs for datasets but prefers URNs for things like SPARQL.\nThat’s a very reasonable point, Timothy, we would love it if you’d post\nin the GitHub link, which is on the slides and hopefully someone can\nstick in the chat, because one of the things we want is a bit of\ndissenting opinion as well.\n\n“How does versioning work with DOIs?” Again, Mateusz, brilliant\nquestion. So, this is my understanding of it, is that, generally\nspeaking, if you publish an updated dataset, let’s say that you’ve got\ndeaths from COVID-19 and then a few days later you think, oh crikey, you\nknow, we missed some off we need to republish it. What you would do is\nin the metadata, so you would give a DOI to the first dataset, and in\nthe metadata of that you would say, this has been updated in DOI for the\ndataset over there. So that’s what you want to try to do so a DOI should\nbe, as I understand it, fixed at a point in time for a specific data\nset. If you update it, gets a new DOI but you can link between them.\n\n“If the data resource moves, how does the DOI still point to it?” Yep.\nAgain. So this all comes down to metadata. So in your metadata fields,\nyou’ll have the name, the author, date, blah blah blah, and you will\nalso have the URL where this resource lives. So, if we, you know, if we\ndecide that we no longer want to be gov.uk/data, and instead\ngov.uk/api/data, you would go into the metadata of that DOI - well, the\nowner of the document would go into the metadata of that DOI - and\nupdate the record to show where it points.\n\nNow, there is an interesting point here, in that, you know, what happens\nif we decide to delete a document or we never update metadata? Well, one\nof the things about DOIs is, because they are distributed, other people\ncan take copies of your dataset or document and provide them via the\nDOI. So if you’re at a university, for example, you might go to your\nuniversity library and say, here’s a DOI for this, and they would serve\nyou up a local copy of the paper, or the dataset. So, even if we do\nforget to update our metadata, the documents will still be out there for\nother people to cite.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nI think that’s all the questions, unless there are any on Slack that\nI’ve missed, Charles? Or anyone else?\n\nCharles Baird\n\nNothing on Slack. Again, it’s like a personal attack. But just on that\nnote, I’ve put your slides on there, and I’ve also put direct links to\nthe two things for feedback so people can get to our GitHub repo from\nthere, and to the blog post as well.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nBrilliant. Well, my contact details are on those slides. If you have any\nquestions about this, any thoughts, any concerns especially, please,\nplease, please drop me an email or go onto GitHub and leave a comment\nthere. Our plan is, as we move through this year, we’ll start off a\ntrial, doing DOIs, probably having the British Library as our partner to\npublish them, and probably using Office for National Statistics as our\ntrial partner. But if you would really like to be our trial partner,\nplease do drop me a note.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nWe’ve got someone called Jon Johnson with their hand up.\n\nCharles Baird\n\nOh yes.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nJon I don’t know if you’re still there and if you want to unmute\nyourself. Let me allow you to unmute.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nSo Jon has shared a copy of a DOI for an ONS thing from the UK data\nservice, which, you know, looks good. So, that, hopefully you can take a\nlook at that and get an idea of what we’re doing with them. But Jon, are\nyou, are you there?\n\nCharles Baird\n\nThink Jon’s having some technical issues.\n\nGair McAdie\n\nWell, I think he’s not a presenter, he’s, he’s not allowed to unmute.\n\nSarah Johns\n\nHold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nWe got pretty far, well done everyone!\n\nJohn Johnson\n\nJust to say, I mean, I mean I work in the university although I’m not an\nacademic. I used to work at data, the UK data service. But it is one of\nthose sort of frustrations really of generically across using government\ndata, is that it’s very difficult to know what version you’re using. You\nknow, so even something that you’d think would be nailed down quite\ntightly, like employment classifications, you know, it’s published as a\nPDF. But the PDF’s not even versioned. You know, it’s just, and it\ncauses, you know, mayhem, which is why, you know, you’re doing what\nyou’re doing, you know, at the end of the day.\n\nAnd the good thing about DOIs is it, you know, I think it does package\nup definitive things, consumable objects as opposed to individual items\nwhich you can get through APIs. And I think it will make a significant\ndifference in terms of provenancing what’s going on because a lot of the\nmisreporting is primarily down to just not knowing the provenance of\nthings like, even things like region and basic geographies and things\nlike that. So that’s a quite an important part of an infrastructure that\ncan be relied upon.\n\nTerence Eden\n\nYeah, I think you’re exactly right. We know that there is a problem with\npublishing PDFs and then they get silently updated. Obviously, you know,\na DOI by itself doesn’t help that, but hopefully it will encourage\npeople to think more about those things.\n\nA really interesting question, sorry, has just come in from Mateusz,\nwhich is “Is DOI only for public data?” That’s a heck of a question. So,\nI mean, in theory, no, you could, you know, if you have a top secret\ndata set of whatever, you could assign a DOI to it. If people found that\nDOI they would be able to find the metadata for it but they wouldn’t\nnecessarily be able to retrieve the document if it was on a private\nintranet for example. I’m not sure what the, I’m not sure whether it\nwould be helpful to add DOIs to private data, but if you think there’s a\nuse case for it then yeah, that’s definitely something we’d look at. I\nreally haven’t considered it before.\n4. Closing remarks\nCharles Baird\n\nWe’ve run out of questions, but thank you so much, Terence, that was\nreally interesting. And even for those of us like me who have, who are\nsupposed to have listened to that presentation before, it was great.\n\nI just wanted to close up today with a huge thanks to all of our\nspeakers to Terence, to Jacqui, and Katie, and Tony, and Gair on the\npanel, and especially to Rosalie for, both for hosting that today and\nfor all of her contributions to the API community over the last few\nyears, obviously we wouldn’t be here without you. I’ve no idea if you’re\non the call so this might be, you know, just shouting into the void.\n\nBut hopefully, all of you guys will sign up for the next one of these,\nwhich will be, as I said, as Sarah says, rather, at the end of February,\nfor, with a focus on geospatial.\n\nIn the meantime, you can see on screen, do get in touch with us at any\nof those email addresses. Please do sign up for the Slack. It is, as I\nsay, it’s experimental. We may well end up folding it back into\ncross-government Slack, we’ll see how it goes, but it’s a good place to\nshare this kind of stuff, and to chat between meetings.\n\nAnd one last plug for the various parts of the new API programme. We’ll\nsend out something on the Google group next week about the GitHub, and\nthe data standards catalogue for you to have a look at and start to\ncontribute to. I’ve already mentioned Slack so that’s pointless notes,\nand finally just another call out because it was sort of in the middle\nof my presentation earlier, for, if anyone is interested in being an\nassessor for our prototype API assessment programme, then we would\nwelcome you with open arms.\n\nSo with that, thanks again to everyone who spoke thanks to, thanks for\nall of you to coming, and we look forward to seeing you at the end of\nFebruary, and for, and to speaking to you on Slack - shameless, the last\nshameless plug - in the meantime. So enjoy the rest of your day and\nthanks again.\n","url":"/standards-catalogue/dsa-publications/apic-190121-transcript/"},"30":{"title":"Miscellaneous","content":"DSA Publications:Description:\nThese are documents produced by the Data Standards Authority\nTranscript of the API and Data Exchange Community Workshop, January 2021","url":"/standards-catalogue/dsa-publications/"}}}
